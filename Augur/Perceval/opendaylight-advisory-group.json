Note that graduation reviews and mature are technical terms defined in the project lifecycle document here:\nhttps://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases\nThis thread should serve as good, if lengthy, background on what that question including differing opinions on what can be (and should be) in scope for the review under our current governing documents as well as what we might like to see if we were willing to change our governing documents. Any input from the Advisory Group on either or both of those would be interesting and much appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n--Colin\n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 11:22 PM, Luke, Chris <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com> wrote:\n\nI skimmed the thread and definitely think the AG can provide some guidance.?\n\nCould I ask for a succinct statement of the query and its background?

This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.? \n\n-Neela\n\n\nNicolas (Neela) Jacques | Executive Director | OpenDaylight Project |?650-704-7029\n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 3:25 PM, Edward Warnicke <hagbard at gmail.com> wrote:\nComments inline... \n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 2:49 PM, Daniel Farrell <dfarrell at redhat.com> wrote:\n> I would not expect a reasonable engineer to spontaneously think that\n> he should add information to the Graduation Review 'History of Releases\n> (using Mature Release Process)' section for 'Security Issues'.\n\nThat's not what I had in mind, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding\nsomething. I wasn't around when this was written, so that seems likely.\n\nSticking with the security example, I'm proposing we make use of the\n\nHistory of Releases -> Release Review -> Security Issues\n\nchain to consider \"opinions about the contents of [the] 'Security Issues'\nsection\" during Graduation Reviews.\n\nSure... I would find it pretty reasonable to follow the links to the Release Reviews\nand look at their Security Issues sections.? That's just taking a look at the supporting collateral\nbacking the claim for having followed the Mature Release process.\n?\n\nComing back to what I may be misunderstanding...\n\nIs \"Maturity\" here just about following the process, creating the right\nwikis at the right times and such? A project with a Release Review that\nsays all the most horrible things (late, introduced malware, whatever)\ncan be \"Mature\", as long as they follow the process? Or am I missing\na step that would block such projects from reaching \"Mature\"?\n\nYeah, that is an interesting question.? Part of the intention as I remember it originally\nwas to have Mature be mostly mechanical and not political (thus its requirements are\nmostly mechanical, and not political), and to try to have it be stuff that would be?\npretty obviously true or false after the fact (example: Working code base.? Definitely\ntricky to lay out a precise set of ticky boxes for without having a code base in front of you,\nbut not all that hard to determine about a code base you are looking at).\n\nLate is an interesting question, because the Mature Release process is *not* the Simultaneous Release\nprocess... its most definitely simpler.? For example, the TSC *can* (and does, often for reasons I whole?\nheartedly endorse) layer on quite a bit more structure than the Mature Release Process does.\nAs written, the Mature Release Process is mostly about \"Did you let folks know what you thought you thought you were\ndoing so there was some hope of non-insider engaging\" and \"Did you let folks know what you actually delivered\nso there's some clarity there\".? Stuff happens, and if you chain people to their Release Plans,\nthey will be both timid in them, and also incredibly resistant to actually trying to put into\nthem things that other folks need that are less central to what they care about.? So I would be very reluctant to consider 'late' or\n'didn't deliver everything listed in release' plan, because I suspect they'd incent very damaging\ncompensating behaviors.? If someone shows up to a project willing to do some useful work the project\nthinks is a good idea... dinging the project for it not happening will strongly incent turning them away\n(the opposite of what we want).? And if I depend on something from another project for one of my deliverables...\nI am very unlikely to take the risk of putting that deliverable in my plan if I'm going to be dinged for it.? It tends to\ndiscourage, rather than encourage collaboration and striving.\n\nIn some sense, thinking through things like the question you just raised here, is part of why *actually* changing\nthe governance (with the attendant thought and care) seems much more reasonable to me than what, to me, feels\nlike very broad creep by interpretation.? The project lifecycle change process forces rather a lot more deliberation.\n\nI'm actually quite open to discussions about \"Lets look at whether we want to rework the project lifecycle\".? I'm going to have\nmy own principles around that which I feel passionate about (like trying to keep it mechanical and not political,\nand trying to make it obvious to a reasonable engineer)... but those personal biases (much as I may be fond of them,\nand wish others would adopt them, and much as I'd advocate for them) are not necessarily binding on such a discussion.\n\nEd\n\n?\n\nDaniel Farrell\nSoftware Engineer, Red Hat SDN Team\nhttps://twitter.com/dfarrell07\n\n----- Original Message -----\n> Dan,\n>\n> From my point of view, roughly yes.?

This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.\n>\n> -Neela\n>\n>\n> Nicolas (Neela) Jacques | Executive Director | OpenDaylight Project | 650-704-7029\n>\n> On Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 3:25 PM, Edward Warnicke <hagbard at gmail.com> wrote:\n> Comments inline...\n>\n> On Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 2:49 PM, Daniel Farrell <dfarrell at redhat.com> wrote:\n>> I would not expect a reasonable engineer to spontaneously think that\n>> he should add information to the Graduation Review 'History of Releases\n>> (using Mature Release Process)' section for 'Security Issues'.\n> That's not what I had in mind, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding\n> something.

We?re not being asked to debate the semantic use of the word, rather the state a project must be in to qualify as a ?fully functioning, successful open source project.?\n\nThis is our first formal such request; I suggest we discuss on-list and at the end of the week I?ll see if we have any conclusions to summarize.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Monday, September 28, 2015 10:59 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nCc: Neela Jacques; discuss at lists.opendaylight.org; tsc at lists.opendaylight.org; Todd Benzies; Philip Robb\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight TSC] [OpenDaylight Discuss] First pass at Graduation Review Tempalte\n\nThe really succinct, statement is we're trying to to come to an agreement about what the TSC should bear in mind and ask for as collateral when we start holding graduation reviews to move projects to mature. Note that graduation reviews and mature are technical terms defined in the project lifecycle document here:\nhttps://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases\nThis thread should serve as good, if lengthy, background on what that question including differing opinions on what can be (and should be) in scope for the review under our current governing documents as well as what we might like to see if we were willing to change our governing documents. Any input from the Advisory Group on either or both of those would be interesting and much appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n--Colin\n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 11:22 PM, Luke, Chris <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com> wrote:\n\nI skimmed the thread and definitely think the AG can provide some guidance. \n\nCould I ask for a succinct statement of the query and its background?

This is exactly the type of question we shouldn't be guessing as to what end users want and expect but getting real input and data. Mature is inherently a label who's primary use is to convey a certain level of expectations for an end-users. We should make sure that whatever process we ask a project to follow to measure whether they get this label fits as well as we can with what an end-user would assume such a label means (My 7 year old definitely thinks he exhibits a high level of maturity, and based on his own definition of maturity he probably does. Unfortunately for him it doesn't so much matter whether he meets his own definition of mature but whether he meets ours). Phil and Todd can facilitate formulating the questions, and/or creating a forum for discussion.  \n\n-Neela\n\n\nNicolas (Neela) Jacques | Executive Director | OpenDaylight Project | 650-704-7029\n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 3:25 PM, Edward Warnicke <hagbard at gmail.com> wrote:\nComments inline... \n\nOn Thu, Sep 24, 2015 at 2:49 PM, Daniel Farrell <dfarrell at redhat.com> wrote:\n> I would not expect a reasonable engineer to spontaneously think that \n> he should add information to the Graduation Review 'History of \n> Releases (using Mature Release Process)' section for 'Security Issues'.\n\nThat's not what I had in mind, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding something. I wasn't around when this was written, so that seems likely.\n\nSticking with the security example, I'm proposing we make use of the\n\nHistory of Releases -> Release Review -> Security Issues\n\nchain to consider \"opinions about the contents of [the] 'Security Issues'\nsection\" during Graduation Reviews.\n\nSure... I would find it pretty reasonable to follow the links to the Release Reviews and look at their Security Issues sections.  That's just taking a look at the supporting collateral backing the claim for having followed the Mature Release process.\n \n\nComing back to what I may be misunderstanding...\n\nIs \"Maturity\" here just about following the process, creating the right wikis at the right times and such? A project with a Release Review that says all the most horrible things (late, introduced malware, whatever) can be \"Mature\", as long as they follow the process? Or am I missing a step that would block such projects from reaching \"Mature\"?\n\nYeah, that is an interesting question.  Part of the intention as I remember it originally was to have Mature be mostly mechanical and not political (thus its requirements are mostly mechanical, and not political), and to try to have it be stuff that would be pretty obviously true or false after the fact (example: Working code base.  Definitely tricky to lay out a precise set of ticky boxes for without having a code base in front of you, but not all that hard to determine about a code base you are looking at).\n\nLate is an interesting question, because the Mature Release process is *not* the Simultaneous Release process... its most definitely simpler.  For example, the TSC *can* (and does, often for reasons I whole heartedly endorse) layer on quite a bit more structure than the Mature Release Process does.\nAs written, the Mature Release Process is mostly about \"Did you let folks know what you thought you thought you were doing so there was some hope of non-insider engaging\" and \"Did you let folks know what you actually delivered so there's some clarity there\".  Stuff happens, and if you chain people to their Release Plans, they will be both timid in them, and also incredibly resistant to actually trying to put into them things that other folks need that are less central to what they care about.  So I would be very reluctant to consider 'late' or 'didn't deliver everything listed in release' plan, because I suspect they'd incent very damaging compensating behaviors.  If someone shows up to a project willing to do some useful work the project thinks is a good idea... dinging the project for it not happening will strongly incent turning them away (the opposite of what we want).  And if I depend on something from another project for one of my deliverables...\nI am very unlikely to take the risk of putting that deliverable in my plan if I'm going to be dinged for it.  It tends to discourage, rather than encourage collaboration and striving.\n\nIn some sense, thinking through things like the question you just raised here, is part of why *actually* changing the governance (with the attendant thought and care) seems much more reasonable to me than what, to me, feels like very broad creep by interpretation.  The project lifecycle change process forces rather a lot more deliberation.\n\nI'm actually quite open to discussions about \"Lets look at whether we want to rework the project lifecycle\".  I'm going to have my own principles around that which I feel passionate about (like trying to keep it mechanical and not political, and trying to make it obvious to a reasonable engineer)... but those personal biases (much as I may be fond of them, and wish others would adopt them, and much as I'd advocate for them) are not necessarily binding on such a discussion.\n\nEd\n\n \n\nDaniel Farrell\nSoftware Engineer, Red Hat SDN Team\nhttps://twitter.com/dfarrell07\n\n----- Original Message -----\n> Dan,\n>\n> From my point of view, roughly yes.  Part of the question though is \n> how far a stretch it is.\n> If the TSC were holding a Release Review for a project, opinions about \n> the contents of its 'Security Issues' section that are germane to the \n> handling of 'Security Issues' seems perfectly in scope.\n> My opinion is that adding a 'Security Issues' section to the \n> Graduation Review outside of the process of actually adding that \n> section, or sticking such a section under another section should \n> properly involve revising the Project Lifecycle to do so.\n>\n> I would also argue for the heuristic: \"Would a reasonable engineer \n> obviously see something as part of the stated section a priori\"\n> is a good litmus test.  I would maintain that a reasonable engineer, \n> when preparing their Security Issue's section for a Release Review \n> would reasonably think to include information about what security \n> issues have been raised and how they were handled.

Mature projects could go away but only with careful attention by\nthe community to a migration plan to something else that fills the need.\n\nWith that viewpoint, the criteria of graduation to me should be dependent on\nthe existing community agreeing that the function is stable, documented and\nthe community large enough to support ongoing integration with the rest of\nthe code base.  The community can best judge that but I would be looking for\ncommitters from two or more companies as a sign of that health and how well\nthey are meeting the various milestones where they are supporting the\nproduct integration points.\n\nAs a customer I may have my favorite projects but it's really more about the\ncommunity committing to the long term support of that project.\n_______________________________________________\nadvisory-group mailing list\nadvisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/advisory-group\n\n\n\n"

Mature projects could go away but only with careful attention by\nthe community to a migration plan to something else that fills the need.\n\nWith that viewpoint, the criteria of graduation to me should be dependent on\nthe existing community agreeing that the function is stable, documented and\nthe community large enough to support ongoing integration with the rest of\nthe code base.  The community can best judge that but I would be looking for\ncommitters from two or more companies as a sign of that health and how well\nthey are meeting the various milestones where they are supporting the\nproduct integration points.\n\nAs a customer I may have my favorite projects but it's really more about the\ncommunity committing to the long term support of that project.\n_______________________________________________\nadvisory-group mailing list\nadvisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/advisory-group\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nadvisory-group mailing list\nadvisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/advisory-group\n\n"

The other way round may create confusion.\n\n* provide support for programmatic upgrades, e.g., no or minimal human effort to upgrade from Beryllium to Boron\n\n1++ This is an absolute MUST. I would really pay attention to the cases where it is not possible to have a zero-effort upgrade and make sure that the platform provides clear information on what steps to follow to fix incompatibilities. That is not typically the case in a stack trace :-)\n\n* support for continuous release for individual projects\n\nNaturally, the TSC has already heard about the importance of documentation and compatibility in future releases, so we don?t need to focus on those too much.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nIn addition, here is some food for thought for the core team:\n\nThere is something that is bugging me. Imagine I have two applications running independently on top of the SAL. These two applications, at a given point in time, send commands towards one and the same network element and these commands happen to be contradictory: like activate and shut down an interface or forward and drop a packet, etc. How should ODL handle this situations to produce a predictable and reproduce-able behaviour?\n\nBest, /PA\n\n---\nDr. Pedro A.

        "body": {
            "plain": "Advisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

            "plain": "So summarizing, and adding my comments:\n\n\n-          Core is only a functional state; it labels items critical to the system, upon which other key features depend. Care must be taken to not make 'core' a subjective label.\n\n-          Mature and stable are quality labels; even though we can discern more than one such state, end-users really only care about a label that gives them confidence that the system will work as expected. This end-user expectation may vary and that is where the difference between stable and mature comes in. (stable may be good enough for the lab; mature required for production, for example)\n\n-          There is a loose relationship between functional states and quality states; though arguably a core project needs to be stable/mature in order for dependent projects to also be stable/mature.\n\nIs this a fair summary?\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nFrom: Williamson, Beau [mailto:Beau.Williamson at T-Mobile.com]\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 9:57 AM\nTo: Alex_Zhang; Luke, Chris; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: RE: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nI agree with Alex and Margaret.\n\nBeau Williamson\nCCIE #1346 R/S Emeritus\nPrinciple Member of Technical Staff\nCorporate Engineering\nmetroPCS/T-Mobile\nInternal: 314982\nOffice:   469.330.4982\nMobile:   972.679.4334\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Alex_Zhang\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 12:14 AM\nTo: 'Luke, Chris'; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nYes, busy in Dusselfdorf with WIFI hunt....\n\n\"mature\", \"stable\" are quality state.

            "plain": "Hi Chris -\nTrying to dissect the issue -\nIs the issue actually NETCONF ?  IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).\nSounded like the latter?\nAt TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller\nrather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] on behalf of Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com]\nSent: 22 October 2015 16:46\nTo: 'advisory-group'\nSubject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\n\nAdvisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn't parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a \"sloppy mount\").

Care must be taken to not make 'core' a subjective label.\n\n-          Mature and stable are quality labels; even though we can discern more than one such state, end-users really only care about a label that gives them confidence that the system will work as expected. This end-user expectation may vary and that is where the difference between stable and mature comes in. (stable may be good enough for the lab; mature required for production, for example)\n\n-          There is a loose relationship between functional states and quality states; though arguably a core project needs to be stable/mature in order for dependent projects to also be stable/mature.\n\nIs this a fair summary?\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nFrom: Williamson, Beau [mailto:Beau.Williamson at T-Mobile.com]\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 9:57 AM\nTo: Alex_Zhang; Luke, Chris; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: RE: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nI agree with Alex and Margaret.\n\nBeau Williamson\nCCIE #1346 R/S Emeritus\nPrinciple Member of Technical Staff\nCorporate Engineering\nmetroPCS/T-Mobile\nInternal: 314982\nOffice:   469.330.4982\nMobile:   972.679.4334\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Alex_Zhang\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 12:14 AM\nTo: 'Luke, Chris'; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nYes, busy in Dusselfdorf with WIFI hunt....\n\n\"mature\", \"stable\" are quality state.

Care must be taken to not make ?core? a subjective label.\n\n-          Mature and stable are quality labels; even though we can discern more than one such state, end-users really only care about a label that gives them confidence that the system will work as expected. This end-user expectation may vary and that is where the difference between stable and mature comes in. (stable may be good enough for the lab; mature required for production, for example)\n\n-          There is a loose relationship between functional states and quality states; though arguably a core project needs to be stable/mature in order for dependent projects to also be stable/mature.\n\nIs this a fair summary?\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nFrom: Williamson, Beau [mailto:Beau.Williamson at T-Mobile.com]\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 9:57 AM\nTo: Alex_Zhang; Luke, Chris; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: RE: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nI agree with Alex and Margaret.\n\nBeau Williamson\nCCIE #1346 R/S Emeritus\nPrinciple Member of Technical Staff\nCorporate Engineering\nmetroPCS/T-Mobile\nInternal: 314982\nOffice:   469.330.4982\nMobile:   972.679.4334\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Alex_Zhang\nSent: Friday, October 16, 2015 12:14 AM\nTo: 'Luke, Chris'; 'CHIOSI, MARGARET T'; 'advisory-group'\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Mature vs. Core\n\nYes, busy in Dusselfdorf with WIFI hunt?.\n\n?mature?, ?stable? are quality state.

We have been also doing some research on that and this is our current take too: could be something you might want to do in a specific domain (and OF is a good candidate, while netconf might no because it?s more difficult to extract meta-information about the clash there) while going cross technology/domain/protocol is extremely complex.\n\nBest, /PA\nDe: Colin Dixon <colin at colindixon.com<mailto:colin at colindixon.com>>\nFecha: viernes, 23 de octubre de 2015, 21:30\nPara: paag <pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com<mailto:pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com>>\nCC: \"Luke, Chris\" <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>>, advisory-group <advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nAsunto: Re: [advisory-group] Agenda for Thursdays AG call\n\nFor what it's worth, dealing with conflicting commands being sent to devices is something we're aware of and thinking about. We've been making a lot of progress on the topic in a specific domain around OpenFlow and multiple apps controlling vSwitches when there is a combination applications attempting to provide network virtualization and service chaining.\n\nThe ideas we've been developing and some of the code we've started writing could be generalized, but it's not a panacea. We'd probably need to know what protocols you were interested in for this. Cross-protocol things are possible, but much more complex.\n\nI'll add this to the list of things I've heard people asking for.\n\n--Colin\n\nOn Tue, Oct 20, 2015 at 10:39 AM, PEDRO ANDRES ARANDA GUTIERREZ <pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com<mailto:pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com>> wrote:\nHi,\n\nAnswers inline?\n\nHope not to introduce too much noise,\n/PA\nDe: <advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>> en nombre de \"Luke, Chris\" <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>>\nFecha: martes, 20 de octubre de 2015, 16:21\nPara: 'advisory-group' <advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nAsunto: [advisory-group] Agenda for Thursdays AG call\n\nAll,\n\nColin and I have been discussing the upcoming Boron release. The TSC would like to seek our input on the release, and in particular what?s ?most missing? from the current plans so I have invited Colin, at the next call, to present us with the plans such as they may currently be and then we can provide feedback, either/both in the remainder of the call or on this list.\n\nFor some background material, here?s some details Colin shared with me.\n\nRelease topics were on the last TSC agenda: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/TSC:Main#Agenda\n\nMostly, these items are not project-specific, but more about how we can fix some issues we've had in past releases, including:\n\n* doing a release faster than 6 months?\n\nIMvHO that would give an impression of lack of stability and may deter a couple of users in the ?corporate spectrum?.\n\n* allow for compatibility between releases, e.g., \"apps\" in the Boron release should be able to run on Beryllium\n\nBackwards compatibility would be a more than nice to have feature. The other way round may create confusion.\n\n* provide support for programmatic upgrades, e.g., no or minimal human effort to upgrade from Beryllium to Boron\n\n1++ This is an absolute MUST. I would really pay attention to the cases where it is not possible to have a zero-effort upgrade and make sure that the platform provides clear information on what steps to follow to fix incompatibilities. That is not typically the case in a stack trace :-)\n\n* support for continuous release for individual projects\n\nNaturally, the TSC has already heard about the importance of documentation and compatibility in future releases, so we don?t need to focus on those too much.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\nIn addition, here is some food for thought for the core team:\n\nThere is something that is bugging me. Imagine I have two applications running independently on top of the SAL. These two applications, at a given point in time, send commands towards one and the same network element and these commands happen to be contradictory: like activate and shut down an interface or forward and drop a packet, etc. How should ODL handle this situations to produce a predictable and reproduce-able behaviour?\n\nBest, /PA\n\n---\nDr. Pedro A.

IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).\nSounded like the latter?\nAt TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller\nrather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] on behalf of Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com]\nSent: 22 October 2015 16:46\nTo: 'advisory-group'\nSubject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nAdvisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.\n\nAlso, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.\n\nBeau Williamson\nCCIE #1346 R/S Emeritus\nPrinciple Member of Technical Staff\nCorporate Engineering\nmetroPCS/T-Mobile\nInternal: 314982\nOffice:   469.330.4982\nMobile:   972.679.4334\n\nFrom: jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com<mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com> [mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com]\nSent: Monday, October 26, 2015 9:40 AM\nTo: Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>; Williamson, Beau; mc3124 at att.com<mailto:mc3124 at att.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\n\nYep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.\nOther thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com]\nSent: 26 October 2015 14:28\nTo: Williamson, Beau; Beasley, Jonathan (Financial&Risk); mc3124 at att.com<mailto:mc3124 at att.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nMore correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device.

IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).\nSounded like the latter?\nAt TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller\nrather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] on behalf of Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com]\nSent: 22 October 2015 16:46\nTo: 'advisory-group'\nSubject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nAdvisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don't conform to ODL's interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn't parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a \"sloppy mount\"). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or \"in development\") devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin's comment though: We shouldn't unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).\nSounded like the latter?\nAt TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller\nrather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] on behalf of Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com]\nSent: 22 October 2015 16:46\nTo: 'advisory-group'\nSubject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nAdvisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don't conform to ODL's interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn't parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a \"sloppy mount\"). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or \"in development\") devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin's comment though: We shouldn't unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

IE, the transport protocol itself isn't working properly with some device implementations? Or is it that the device is not compliant with its own advertised YANG schema definition in terms of the returned XML following a NETCONF call (eg GET-CONFIG).\nSounded like the latter?\nAt TR we're likely to be heavy users of the netconf southbound - If NETCONF is ok but but the advertised YANG is outside of the expected schema spec in some way I'd like options to deal with it upstream of the controller\nrather than it failing at the controller.  Being able to switch the controller into a 'loose' vs 'strict' mode of operation would be nice, on a per-model basis. That way we can test and potentially troubleshoot issues in loose mode and feedback to vendors if their device is misbehaving with our upstream application, or even trap and deal with exception within the upstream app (depends on the schema violation - some may not be that critical to the app in question).\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>] on behalf of Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>]\nSent: 22 October 2015 16:46\nTo: 'advisory-group'\nSubject: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nAdvisors,\n\nWe have another query from the TSC; please see section 4 of the page Colin links below.\n\nThe summary is that there was a discussion regarding how to handle devices that don?t conform to ODL?s interpretation of how NETCONF works. At the moment it requires strict conformance and refuses to mount devices that have any sort of protocol flaw and presumably throws a tantrum if the XML a device returns doesn?t parse according to a YANG model defined for it.\n\nPass-through is suggested; that protocol errors are ignored and (optionally?) any errant XML payload is simply passed through to RESTCONF; this has several issues, including when the caller asks for JSON, and if RESTCONF should be expected to accept similarly flawed XML from a RESTCONF client towards a device when trying to configure it.\n\nAnother approach might be to be relaxed about various violations (Colin calls this a ?sloppy mount?). There was some disagreement on whether specific violations should be tracked; presumably either by logging the violation, or making them available to RESTCONF callers.\n\nAnyway, what do we think? Do we have any specific suggestions to deal with this issue?\n\nPersonally I think we definitely need to be able to relax the rules for known bad (or ?in development?) devices, though it needs a health warning; there has to be some feedback loop to encourage NETCONF vendors to correct broken implementations. To steal Colin?s comment though: We shouldn?t unnecessarily punish end users for their vendors poor behavior.\n\nCheers,\nChris.\n\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2015 8:51 AM\nTo: Luke, Chris\nSubject: Fwd: MD-SAL weekly interest call notes for 10/20/2015\n\nFYI.

            "plain": "Updated summary:\n\n* Distinguish between NETCONF protocol issues and YANG schema conformance in the payload.\n* Loose mode for both is strongly desirable.\n* Especially to support devices that may not yet have a model, or it's known to be incomplete.\n* For schema conformance loose mode, consider making it a per-model tweak.\n* Loose mode should only apply when violations are not structurally ambiguous. Data that cannot be deserialized by a reasonably tolerant parser should always be rejected. This means bad XML (syntactically broken - unbalanced nesting, missing >'s and so on) should probably not be accepted, but semantic issues (not passing yang schema checks, like elements not passing type tests or whole data structures not being defined in the schema at all) should be tolerable. Likewise NETCONF transport issues that are not ambiguous should be tolerable too.\n* ODL northbound should always be well behaved; passthrough must be carefully considered, possibly with a separate endpoint (to make its use explicit in apps)\n* Expect end users to come up with esoteric conditions down the road; when stuff is in production things need to work, even if it's sometimes kludgy. Especially during the next few years with much legacy equipment deployed the need for tolerance in protocols is that bit greater.\n\nAny tweaks, anyone? :)\n\nChris.\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Colin Dixon [mailto:colin at colindixon.com]\n> Sent: Thursday, November 05, 2015 18:16\n> To: Luke, Chris <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>\n> Cc: advisory-group <advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\n> Subject: RE: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant\n> NETCONF\n> \n> \n> On Nov 5, 2015 6:07 PM, \"Luke, Chris\" <Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com\n> <mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com> > wrote:\n> >\n> > I?m going to give up trying to make outlook do something sensible with\n> inline responses, sigh.\n> \n> There are solutions to that... :-P\n> \n> > >> * Loose mode should only apply when violations are not structurally\n> ambiguous.

            "plain": "1. un-parseable payload should be rejected but we need to have loose enforcement of the parsing rules. This lets us deal with valid xml that doesn?t have the niceties of a specific namespace for every tag vs inferred namespace, etc.\n2. pushing data is easier since we will have a payload from the vendor of the xml that is to be pushed in edit-config\n3. pulling data (get-config) is harder because ODL needs to know what to do with data that does not have a matching yang model.\n\ta. I would think something like anyxml could be used to let the application do the mapping.\n\tb. It would be nicer for the service provider/application to provide a mapping file from the xml xpath A to yang datapath B but maybe that ends up being just as much work as having the vendor provide a yang model.\n\tc. I would be happy with the netconf-lite adaptor providing a pointer to \"this is the result of get-config\" . the application could parse it using your standard XML tools and we can do the mapping in our application.\n\td. netconf-lite assumes that application does the xml input and xml parsing as step 1.\n\te. options on top of netconf-lite would provide xml parsing to a generic set of leafs into md-sal of a get-config (but not sure how hard/easy that is)\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Luke, Chris\nSent: Friday, November 06, 2015 8:13 AM\nTo: Colin Dixon\nCc: advisory-group\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\n\nUpdated summary:\n\n* Distinguish between NETCONF protocol issues and YANG schema conformance in the payload.\n* Loose mode for both is strongly desirable.\n* Especially to support devices that may not yet have a model, or it's known to be incomplete.\n* For schema conformance loose mode, consider making it a per-model tweak.\n* Loose mode should only apply when violations are not structurally ambiguous. Data that cannot be deserialized by a reasonably tolerant parser should always be rejected. This means bad XML (syntactically broken - unbalanced nesting, missing >'s and so on) should probably not be accepted, but semantic issues (not passing yang schema checks, like elements not passing type tests or whole data structures not being defined in the schema at all) should be tolerable. Likewise NETCONF transport issues that are not ambiguous should be tolerable too.\n* ODL northbound should always be well behaved; passthrough must be carefully considered, possibly with a separate endpoint (to make its use explicit in apps)\n* Expect end users to come up with esoteric conditions down the road; when stuff is in production things need to work, even if it's sometimes kludgy.

Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.\n\nAlso, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.

The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.\nOther thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.

We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).

This means bad XML (syntactically broken - unbalanced nesting, missing >'s and so on) should probably not be accepted, but semantic issues (not passing yang schema checks, like elements not passing type tests or whole data structures not being defined in the schema at all) should be tolerable. Likewise NETCONF transport issues that are not ambiguous should be tolerable too.\n\n* ODL northbound should always be well behaved; passthrough must be carefully considered, possibly with a separate endpoint (to make its use explicit in apps)\n\n* Expect end users to come up with esoteric conditions down the road; when stuff is in production things need to work, even if it's sometimes kludgy.

Network-wide transactions seems to be begging for an ODL project.\n\nAlso, I know that CLI stuff is really a PITA but I keep hoping that since this is an open source community that someone might contribute some CLI NED's for some common boxes.  Example, unless you upgrade to the more recent versions of SRX in you ALU routers, you are stuck with CLI-based NEDs.  Given ALU's already complex Service provisioning model (my opinion), this makes lack of NETCONF/YANG a PITA.\n\nBeau Williamson\nCCIE #1346 R/S Emeritus\nPrinciple Member of Technical Staff\nCorporate Engineering\nmetroPCS/T-Mobile\nInternal: 314982\nOffice:   469.330.4982\nMobile:   972.679.4334\n\nFrom:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com<mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com> [mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com]\nSent: Monday, October 26, 2015 9:40 AM\nTo: Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>; Williamson, Beau; mc3124 at att.com<mailto:mc3124 at att.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\n\nYep, handling CLI is really hard  - the NEDs do it fairly well but not perfectly in all cases out-of-the-box.  The most complexity occurs where services are changed in a subtle way and the ordering of the CLI commands is important - eg changing the RD of a vrf on a Cisco device.  Short story is that the complexity of the CLI NEDs is the thorn in Tail-F's side, they'd rather not be managing them. Tough project for anyone to take on in ODL.\nOther thing TailF does well is transactions, network-wide.  That to me would be really cool to have in ODL.\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: Luke, Chris [Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com<mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com>]\nSent: 26 October 2015 14:28\nTo: Williamson, Beau; Beasley, Jonathan (Financial&Risk); mc3124 at att.com<mailto:mc3124 at att.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nMore correctly, for legacy devices the NED defines a YANG model to describe the CLI; the remainder of the NED provides a mechanism to talk to that device.

I think the goal is to be able to have ODL cover all devices in the network despite their lack of NETCONF/YANG support.

We'll have a whole bunch of n/w elements which may possibly support Netconf but not the YANG models. We're not going to rip and replace a signficant portion of our network estate to make it work with a controller which demands device YANG schemas, but at the same time we may want to perform service activation consistently through the controller, across a set of devices some of which have a vendor defined YANG schema and others which may only support squirting CLI commands over netconf (ala early Cisco netconf implementations in the ASR9K product range).  The transition of our n/w estate to a set of devices which fully support YANG will happen over time.\n\nJon Beasley\nPrincipal Architect,  Technical Services and Connectivity\nThomson Reuters\nPhone: 0207 542 6674\nMobile 07920 230623\n________________________________\nFrom: CHIOSI, MARGARET T [mc3124 at att.com<mailto:mc3124 at att.com>]\nSent: 23 October 2015 15:19\nTo: Luke, Chris; Beasley, Jonathan (Financial&Risk); advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: RE: TSC query: Handling of non-conformant NETCONF\nWe will be at phases.

At the OPNFV summit all week and have been pretty busy - we actually got around 750 participants\nattending with many carriers who have attended now thinking of joining! So I've been inundated with back-back meetings..\n\nDid someone agree to pull together the list of adapters- equipment to test against(I think that is what Chris asked for)? If not\nI am willing. So just send me your list and I will pull AT&T's list together.\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Luke, Chris [mailto:Chris_Luke at cable.comcast.com] \nSent: Thursday, November 12, 2015 7:17 AM\nTo: Alex_Zhang; 'PEDRO ANDRES ARANDA GUTIERREZ'; 'Williamson, Beau'; CHIOSI, MARGARET T; 'Harvey Newman'; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: RE: [advisory-group] Interop testing with real network devices\n\nI do think we have a role in this though. I'm not suggesting we govern anything, merely provide specific direction - because that is our remit.\n\nIf any among us can provide some test resources too, even better.\n\nBut right now I would rather us give a message of \"needs improvement, here's some specifics\" rather than \"it's broken, fix it.\" We do ourselves no favors with the latter.

I would like PTLs to think about one or more use cases, provide a description of what problem you are to resolve, a brief steps how to setup in ODL, preferable a demo video for users to follow step by step. The goal is to enable user to download and run the ODL SDN controller.\n\nI list some projects that agreed to provide demo videos, please feel free to add your project to the page,  I would also like to collect use cases from community users, please fill the following form with a use case you would like to see, or how to use ODL to achieve what you would like to do, we will circulate those in the community and see if we can provide a solution for your use case.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k_kurc_R6M-0E_7Nj7WCFkmYsHlUURLyme9jWzFaBCg\n\nThanks,\nGeorge\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/attachments/20151207/24788368/attachment.html>\n"

        "body": {
            "plain": "Dear Advisory Group,\n\nAs the mail below highlights, the TSC is in the process of discussing and\nlikely approving significant changes to who will sit on the TSC.\n\nThe major change is that we will likely be ending platinum designates\n(appointed members from the platinum companies) as the major constituents\nof the TSC. This is something that was intended since the beginning of\nOpenDaylight; the platinum designates were only ever intended to be a\nbootstrapping mechanism until the technical members of the community were\nnumerous enough and could be identified to make up the TSC. There appears\nto be a strong belief that we have hit that point.\n\nHowever, the original plan for the makeup of the TSC expected that there\nwould be core projects at this point and the PTLs of the core projects\nwould be the TSC members from the technical community. We do not yet have\ncore projects, so the current discussion is looking at having TSC members\ncome from a combination of committers-at-large (any committer could be\nelected) and PTLs of projects (possibly with a preference to mature\nprojects).\n\nBeyond this, there are discussions about whether PTLs should be drawn from\nall projects with no categorization or if we should split projects into\ndifferent constituencies,  e.g., kernel, protocol,  and apps.\n\nLastly, there is discussion about capping the number of TSC members that\ncould come from any one company.\n\nIf you have thoughts on any of this and would like to chime in,  feel free\nto do so here or on the TSC list.  The archives of discussion so far can be\nfound here:\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-December/thread.html\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/tsc/2015-November/thread.html\n\nSearch for \"waiver\" and you should find the long discussion.\n\nCheers,\n--Colin\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: \"Colin Dixon\" <colin at colindixon.com>\nDate: Dec 8, 2015 5:27 PM\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight TSC] [OpenDaylight Board] [OPENDAYLIGHT BYLAW\nWAIVER - TSC COMPOSITION] Discussion.\nTo: \"Neela Jacques\" <njacques at linuxfoundation.org>\nCc: <board at lists.opendaylight.org>, \"Christopher Price\" <\nchristopher.price at ericsson.com>, \"Edward Warnicke\" <hagbard at gmail.com>,\n\"Daniel Farrell\" <dfarrell at redhat.com>, <tsc at lists.opendaylight.org>\n\nI'd be more than happy to bring the advisory group into the discussion or\n> at least make them aware of what's going on.\n>\n> --Colin\n> On Dec 7, 2015 10:43 PM, \"Neela Jacques\" <njacques at linuxfoundation.org>\n> wrote:\n>\n>> I like the way all this is progressing but I do want to make an important\n>> point re caps for you all to consider.\n>>\n>> I am asked about the concern regarding the ability for one company to get\n>> \"control\" over and over again.

I know AT&T?s w/r to controller and virtualization are moving in that direction.\n\n-        We do try to move POC to field trial. But the progress is uncertain because we need more VNFs besides vBNG to support service chaining, most current VNFs are poor at performance. BTW, we already have several field trials for vBRAS in some metro networks. But those are vendor?s proprietary controller instead of OLD. Prushing vendors to move those controllers to ODL is another choice for us.\n\nAlso are you planning on contributing applications (like policy engine) back into ODL?\n\n-        Yes. Actually, we are seeking a new policy engine from ODL project to replace our policy module. GBP and NEMO are under evaluation, how to simplify abstraction concepts to end user in above two projects is headache problem for us.\n\nI am noticing a lot of participation in ODL and OPNFV by the Chinese companies.\n\nMaybe ODL/LF should invest in a company to translate the documents into Chinese.\n\n-        As far as I know, some Chinese tech websites start translation work as mentioned by George.

            "plain": "This is really good feedback.\n\nWhen it comes to fleshing out current plugins, I think different PTLs are\napproach things differently. That being said, my suggestion is to send\ne-mails to the relevant lists either referring to a new feature or a\ndocumented bug/issue. Some (really most) projects track new features as\nbugs with the severity set to \"enhancement\".\n\nAfter the e-mail,\n1.) make sure the bugfix and/or new feature actually appears on the release\nplan for the project\n2.) make sure to actually try it out during the development cycle to make\nsure it's doing what you expected\n\nFor projects with waning interest, the right approach is obviously going to\ndepend on the project and situation. It never hurts to let people know that\nyou're actually using it and explaining how so that the developers know\nwhat they're doing matters. That being said, it might not be enough if\nthere are business concerns that shift attention.one way or another. You\ncan mitigate that by trying to make sure more than one vendor is\nsignificantly involved in things, but I know that's not always easy.\n\nSpecific to Boron, it sounds like there's a few asks here:\n\na.) Try to connect users into the per-project feature request and\ndevelopment during the release cycle. This is a great idea, but at the very\nleast will take time and cycles from users to engage and make sure things\nactually happen. Also,\n\nb.) You'd like to see Add-Path support in the BPG project.\n\nc.) You'd like to see some NETCONF changes. Are these more or less the same\nones that we had the previous thread about?\n\n--Colin\n\n\nOn Mon, Dec 21, 2015 at 9:50 PM, CHIOSI, MARGARET T <mc3124 at att.com> wrote:\n\n> Colin:\n>\n> 1.

SLAs for support?\n\nNotes on how often to upgrade:\n* upgrade every other seems more common than on every release\n* it depends on how easy it is to upgrade\n    * every six months seems crazy for operators if it's a critical component\n* comcast just moved off of Essex for openstack (released early 2012)\n* AT&T says six month cadence is about right\n    * If you're forced to upgrade A => B => C vs. A => C that changes some of how\n* Beau says that LTSes seem less relevant, people upgrade when they need new features not on a cadence\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nadvisory-group mailing list\nadvisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/advisory-group\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCe message et ses pieces jointes peuvent contenir des informations confidentielles ou privilegiees et ne doivent donc\npas etre diffuses, exploites ou copies sans autorisation.

Is anyone else working with P4? I might have something from Comcast too by then.\n\nI guess from Colin's questions he (and perhaps other developers) would like to see more information on how we would use P4, and what the interaction model between a controller and a P4 switch might look like. Do we want a controller to worry about loading P4 program blobs?

In order to get transactional behavior from the northbound you need to\neither (a) write to the config data store and then poll the operational\ndata store until it looks the way you'd expect, which is what it sounds\nlike they're doing or (b) implement an RPC and call that to accomplish your\ntransaction, which might better suit their needs.\n\n2.)

Tracked as a requirement from BGP, post-Boron (BUG-5718 is a\nprerequisite)\n- transaction pipelining *will* be fixed in Boron, BUG-5419\n- switching masters is pretty much a \"restart apps\" thing (at least\njudging by the code, not sure what the operational experience is),\nBUG-5280, will be fixed in Boron\n- adding a node should not have a large-scale impact\n\nFor testing -- Vratko is currently designing the test suite, IIRC.\n\n> 5.)

            "plain": "\nI?ve entered some feedback/wish list into the BGPCEP project mailing list that covers things we would like to see wrt clustering for BGP-LS and PCEP.\n\nCopied below.\n---\n\nA few notes on BGP HA clustering.\n\n\n1.       BGP-LS/ BGP\n\na.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.\n\n                                                               i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.\n\n                                                             ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.\n\n                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector\n\nb.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.\n\n                                                               i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors\n\n                                                             ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.\n\n2.       PCEP\n\na.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.\n\nb.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.\n\nc.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.\n\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com\nSent: Friday, May 20, 2016 2:29 AM\nTo: pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] BGP\n\n+1.\n\nAs mentioned during the AG call maybe we can at the very least:\n\n?

BGP-LS/ BGP\n\na.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.\n\n                                                                  i.

Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.\n\n                                                               iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector\n\nb.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.\n\n                                                                  i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors\n\n                                                                 ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.\n\n2.       PCEP\n\na.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.\n\nb.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.\n\nc.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.\n\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com<mailto:johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com>\nSent: Friday, May 20, 2016 2:29 AM\nTo: pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com<mailto:pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] BGP\n\n+1.\n\nAs mentioned during the AG call maybe we can at the very least:\n\n?

The purpose is twofold:\n\n1) A signal to end users that \"badged\" products meet certain technical\nrequirements they may be seeking.\n\n2) Allow vendors/providers to display their commitment to the ODL platform,\nand raise their industry profile by marketing their badges to end users.\n\nOpenStack's badge system models most closely what we've been discussing, if\nthat is familiar to you. There is consensus that the TWG would like an \"ODL\npowered\" designation now, and an \"ODL compatible\" designation down the road\nas the ecosystem grows. We are also discussing pros/cons of an \"ODL\ndistribution\" designation. See the attached doc for details.\n\nOur key questions for you are:\n\n1) Are these three designations meaningful to you as an end user; why/why\nnot? What would be most meaningful?\n\n2) If you are a service provider, would you consider using the \"ODL\npowered\" badge to market your own solutions?\n\nFeel free to reply directly to me or to the group.

BGP-LS/ BGP\n\na.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.\n\n                                                                              i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.\n\n                                                                            ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.\n\n                                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector\n\nb.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.\n\n                                                                              i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors\n\n                                                                            ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.\n\n2.       PCEP\n\na.

BGP-LS/ BGP\n\na.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.\n\n                                                                              i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.\n\n                                                                            ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.\n\n                                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector\n\nb.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.\n\n                                                                              i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors\n\n                                                                            ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.\n\n2.       PCEP\n\na.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.\n\nb.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.\n\nc.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.\n\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com<mailto:johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com>\nSent: Friday, May 20, 2016 2:29 AM\nTo: pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com<mailto:pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] BGP\n\n+1.\n\nAs mentioned during the AG call maybe we can at the very least:\n\n?

BGP-LS/ BGP\n\na.       Today we design around the clustering capability in Li/Be by having separate sessions to each node in the cluster.\n\n                                                                              i.      For a 3 node cluster we have the route reflector establish a session to each ODL node.\n\n                                                                            ii.      Per advice from the community we setup BGP for a non-replicating shard so that the data is not replicated on each node.\n\n                                                                           iii.      Our application checks the status of connectivity and looks for the first available ODL node that has a connected state with the route reflector\n\nb.      We would like to be able to have at least the session data shared across the 3 sessions.\n\n                                                                              i.      We would like to have the data in the LOCRIB available in a single shard so that we could interact with the shard leader even if there were sessions from each ODL node to the route reflectors\n\n                                                                            ii.      We would really like to have the BGP southbound session move with the shard leader so that we did not have to consume 3 BGP sessions from each route reflector that we interact with.\n\n2.       PCEP\n\na.       Today we point the routers at one node in the ODL cluster with a  primary/second site strategy because we are limited by the number of PCEP end points we want to setup in the routers.\n\nb.      We would like to have a mechanism where the PCEP sessions from the routers come up into a floating IP that would move with the shard leader.\n\nc.       The floating IP could be on a primary/second adaptor or some other mechanism that could handle single node failure and still get the data to md-sal so that the application and send update-lsp commands even if there was 1 node down in the cluster.\n\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com<mailto:johan.gustawsson at teliasonera.com>\nSent: Friday, May 20, 2016 2:29 AM\nTo: pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com<mailto:pedroa.aranda at telefonica.com>; advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] BGP\n\n+1.\n\nAs mentioned during the AG call maybe we can at the very least:\n\n?

It aims to produce semantically meaningful abstractions for the dataplane mechanisms; not exposing too much of the internal workings but enough to retain the flexibility it offers. The intention is that you could strip ODL down to the bare essentials and use that as a lean agent on a packet forwarding device. It has some way to go but it is progressing quite well.\n\nChris.\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Luis Gomez\nSent: Friday, July 22, 2016 13:35\nTo: jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com\nCc: advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [advisory-group] Today's OpenDaylight Advisory Group Meeting\n\nFYI, there is already this project in ODL for FD.IO:\n\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Honeycomb/VBD\n\nBR/Luis\n\n\nOn Jul 22, 2016, at 9:55 AM, <jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com<mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com>> <jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com<mailto:jonathan.beasley at thomsonreuters.com>> wrote:\n\nPhil,\nApologies I could not make the last call - very busy here at TR at the moment.\nOne topic I'm interested in is FD.IO and whether there are any plans to integrate support for FD.IO into ODL.

We'll ask the TSC for an update and then we can have an open discussion.\n\nOne hot topic that has come up is SD-WAN. I'd like see if anyone who has been working on SD-WAN would be willing to talk tomorrow, and perhaps present more fully later. Phil is curious whether people are looking at commercial solutions involving ODL in this space and I am curious how people are stitching the moving parts together. I'll bring up the topic and we can see where it goes.\n\nAlso, for anyone planning on being at ONS we might want to talk about organizing an informal gathering.\n\nThanks!\nChris.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/attachments/20170315/ce224d16/attachment.html>\n"

            "plain": "Hi Chris & team,\n\nSounds like a very interesting discussion on the positioning of ODL for SD-WAN. Not to precede that discussion, but I think the bigger play for ODL is always going to be vCPE/uCPE use-case. We will probably have 20 different opinions on what the difference in definition is.\nEspecially considering you ought to look at a \"uCPE\" as a distributed single-tenant (customer) NFVI - and then start to question what the difference to vCPE is in every other regard than different NFVI tiers. Also, with that in mind, there's nothing stopping you from combining the deployment scenarios that originally were labelled separately as SD-WAN, vCPE and uCPE.\n\nSupposedly, and at least according to our marketing department, we were the first operator in Europe to onboard a customer onto an SD-WAN platform just a few days ago via our Finnish OpCo - Sonera:\nhttp://www.teliacompany.com/en/news/news-articles/2017/sonera-launches-the-first-new-generation-enterprise-network-service-in-europe/\n\nBR,\nJohan Gustawsson\n\nFrom: advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:advisory-group-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Luke, Chris\nSent: den 15 mars 2017 23:26\nTo: advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: [advisory-group] Agenda for AG call tomorrow\n\nFellow advisors,\n\nTomorrows agenda is light but we've never had a problem finding things to talk about! We'll ask the TSC for an update and then we can have an open discussion.\n\nOne hot topic that has come up is SD-WAN. I'd like see if anyone who has been working on SD-WAN would be willing to talk tomorrow, and perhaps present more fully later. Phil is curious whether people are looking at commercial solutions involving ODL in this space and I am curious how people are stitching the moving parts together. I'll bring up the topic and we can see where it goes.\n\nAlso, for anyone planning on being at ONS we might want to talk about organizing an informal gathering.\n\nThanks!\nChris.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/attachments/20170316/448b7a4f/attachment.html>\n"

We?ll ask the TSC for an update and then we can have an open discussion.\n\nOne hot topic that has come up is SD-WAN. I?d like see if anyone who has been working on SD-WAN would be willing to talk tomorrow, and perhaps present more fully later. Phil is curious whether people are looking at commercial solutions involving ODL in this space and I am curious how people are stitching the moving parts together. I?ll bring up the topic and we can see where it goes.\n\nAlso, for anyone planning on being at ONS we might want to talk about organizing an informal gathering.\n\nThanks!\nChris.\n_______________________________________________\nadvisory-group mailing list\nadvisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:advisory-group at lists.opendaylight.org>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/advisory-group<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__lists.opendaylight.org_mailman_listinfo_advisory-2Dgroup&d=DwMF-g&c=LFYZ-o9_HUMeMTSQicvjIg&r=SztfZIOl5OrpFd3uRr3g-Q&m=DkBTen0NGamHRXRU_u0yd8RHWa_o79e5KQbNoff_Ri8&s=wKz17BbkuHaGtliz0z6J6FCbFIY4GTdKV63Oy4oUqhE&e=>\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nCe message et ses pieces jointes peuvent contenir des informations confidentielles ou privilegiees et ne doivent donc\n\npas etre diffuses, exploites ou copies sans autorisation.

Current topics can be found at the wiki: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Events:Oxygen_Dev_Forum\n  *   Several large changes are upcoming in OpenDaylight which may have significant impact to existing installations of ODL, including in the Karaf 4 and Yang projects. We should discuss ways in which these sorts of changes can be communicated to end users, not least to minimize surprise when they do land.\n\nCheers,\nChris\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/advisory-group/attachments/20170817/93acd93d/attachment.html>\n"

Obviously the docs\nhave to change.

How can they recommend ODL\nif the docs are wrong in something as fundamental as this?

            "plain": "Members of the ODL Advisory Group,\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the harmonization that LF Networking is enabling is resulting in alignments in a number of areas.  One of these comes in the form of a new LFN End User Advisory Group which was recently given the go-ahead by the Governing Board.   There was an open meeting at ONS in Las Angeles to discuss the focus and composition of the new organization. The wiki page (still under development) and minutes from that initial meeting can be found here: \nLFN End User Advisory Group (EUAG) <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2916362>\n\nComprised of members such as telecommunications carriers, cable operators, network, application, compute or storage service providers who are responsible for the implementation, deployment and support of LFN solutions, the Charter <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG%20Charter%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664238000&api=v2> of the LFN-EUAG includes among other things :\nStrategy and long term planning of feature and functionality alignment across LFN Projects\nThe identification of functional and/or operational concerns which are inhibiting the adoption of LFN solutions\nArchitectures and technical requirements that serve these business areas \nProviding end user perspectives on value and usability of LFN technology\nAreas of focus to address short term business requirements\nProject testing environments, test cases, and/or Proof of Concepts\nMembership eligibility is based upon an individuals job role within an end-user organization and is capped at no more than three individuals from the same company at this time. Membership in the Linux Foundation is not a requirement. The LFN-EUAG operates in purely advisory capacity and will subsume any of the Project specific advisory groups which may have previously existed. \n\nThere are no limits on the total number of members at this time, however consideration will be first given to those currently serving on one of the existing Advisory Groups.\n\nIf you would like to become a member,  please review the End User Advisory Group Charter <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG%20Charter%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664238000&api=v2> and the End User Advisory Group Membership Agreement <https://wiki.lfnetworking.org/download/attachments/2916362/LFN%20EUAG-Agreement%204-13-2018.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1523664218000&api=v2>.
