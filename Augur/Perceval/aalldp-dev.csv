1. Does your project have any plans to be archived?  If your project has no plans for any future active development, project committers can vote to move a project to the Archived State by a Termination Review according to the OpenDaylight Project Lifecycle and Releases document [1].

2. If you projects plans to remain active, does it intend to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release as documented in the Boron Release Plan [2]?  If not, could someone please publicly decline to participate with a message like so: ""The <PROJECT_NAME> project is formally declining to participate in the Boron SR"".



There are no project related activity on Gerrit.



Best Regards,

An Ho
