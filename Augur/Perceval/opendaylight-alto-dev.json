This was a highly debated feature in the\nalto protocol design, and the choice of JSONValue is the final outcome,\ngiven that alto is based on json. A client can figure out the the type from\nthe cost-type associated with each cost map. I assume that augment based on\nthe type maybe one way, but we do not know about the DOM.

Hence, we\nneed to consider how an admin can edit,  upload, and download resource\nfiles.\n3. An admin may need to upload a set of resources. Hence, how this is\naccomplished (automation, scripts) should be considered.\n4. The admin ci should support both upload, download but also set control\noptions.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: <Yuling_C at dell.com>\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: <Yuling_C at dell.com>\nDate: Wed, Apr 15, 2015 at 1:47 PM\nSubject: [release] remote Karaf command does not take multiple arguments?\nTo: controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org, release at lists.opendaylight.org,\nintegration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\n\n\n Hi All,\n\nWe?re facing issues in automated system test that it seems the remote Karaf\ncommand does not take multiple arguments and complained ?too many arguments\nspecified?.

The backgroud is though cost has multiple structures like string, list, etc, for one provider, the type of cost should be static, which means for example, alto-xxx provides one and just one type of cost, cost-xxx, at the same time alto-yyy provides another one and only one type of cost, cost-yyy. Any provider provides only one type. And if it provides cost, then it should use augment statement to add new cost type.\n\n\nThis still has limitations considering when using restconf to get value, it should specify the cost type instead of getting any type of cost.\n\n\nDoes this make sense?\n\n\nThanks,\n\nXin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n??

The CLI should be a\nstandard alone admin client that manages the alto info at a server.

An alternative\nis that the CLI deletes the related data instance (e.g., network map).\nHence, the benefit of your design is that it might be more efficient:\ninstead of delete a network map and then reload, you stop and then restart.\nOne question is how often this happens.

In particular, there is\nthe ODL training for the whole week next week, which means that Kai and\nWang Xi will be busy learning more on ODL. This is great for the long term.\nHere is more proposal for next week:\n\n1. Basic goal: finish T1 to T6 (see slack test channel).\n\n2. Start to conduct code review (both Wendy and I are eager to read the\ndesign).\n\n3. Start to systematically add unit and system tests\n\n4. Start to plan to add new things:\n   Topology (path vector)\n   Demonstrate the use with an ALTO client: in particular GridFTP, or\nMapReduce (Hadoop or Spark).\n\nThe highest priority is to finish 1. To make sure that we accomplish this\nitem, we need a scheduler/champion to monitor tasks and issues of this\nitem. I am wondering if there is one person who can take on this role. Or\nwe can do distributed computing: there is a champion for each of T1 to T6.\nIdeally, the champion is the person who takes on the major missing piece of\neach Ti. Please let me know. If no response, I will make a proposal.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nRichard\n\n\n\n-- \nRichard\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150417/364ebe6e/attachment.html>\n"

What is a goal of defining a default cost field? Or you\nare suggesting that there is a default cost field, say numerical, and then\nuse augment to change (or add) it into another type, when it is, say,\nordinal? My understanding is that augment can only add (\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020#section-7.15).\n\nFor efficient storage, in terms of Java classes, I feel that a possible\ndefinition of a cost-map is the following:\n\nInner level is from string (dst pid name) to the type such as a float\n(numerical) or int (ordinal) or vector (path-vector): HashMap<String,\nInteger> or HashMap<String, Double> or HashMap<String, Vector>, ..\n\nOuter level is a hash map from string (src pidname) to the inner level\nhashmap, e.g.,\nHashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>>\n\nA very dumb inheritance based design is is:\nclass CostMapBase {\n  // base field (meta)\n}\n\nclass CostMapInt extends CostMapBase {\n  HashMap<String, Integer> costmap;\n}\n\nclass CostMapDouble extends CostMapBase {\n  HashMap<String, Double> costmap;\n}\n\nOr if one uses the containment design:\nclass CostMap<ValueType> {\n  // meta\n HashMap<String, HashMap<String, ValueType>> costmap;\n}\n\nI believe that the augment mapping is based on inheritance. Hence, to\nsimulate the first design, the augment defines the whole hashmap of\nhashmap. Make sense?\n\nRichard\n\n\n> On Wed, Apr 22, 2015 at 9:15 AM, Y.

Great work!\n\nHere is some more thinking:\n- Jackson has three methods to process JSON (data binding, tree, and\nstreaming: http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonInFiveMinutes). The cleanest is\ndefinitely data binding, which is the current design.\n\n- An unknown type in RFC7285 is cost map. As we discussed in previous\nemail, it can be\nMap<String, Map<String, Integer>>\nor\nMap<String, Map<String, Double>>\ndepending on the cost-mode. Later, it may become an array...\n\nThe current design is the following\n(alto/alto-commons/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/alto/commons/types/rfc7285/CostMap.java):\n    @JsonProperty(\"meta\")\n    public Meta meta;\n\n    @JsonProperty(\"cost-map\")\n    public Map<String, Map<String, Object>> map\n                        = new LinkedHashMap<String, Map<String, Object>>();\n\nThis is a clever design using Object.\n\nOne question: I have not tested the code. Given that the northbound writing\nis public String asJSON(Object obj) throws Exception {\n        return mapper.writeValueAsString(obj);\n    }\n\nIs it RFC7285 compliant (i.e., output int or double for cost map)?\n\nSuppose we do want the more specific type (e.g., some cost being int and\nsome being double is not allowed), so that Object is changed to a specific\nValueType, then generic binding may not work, and we will need to use the\nstreaming parser:\n\n  JsonFactory f = new JsonFactory();\n  JsonParser jp = f.createJsonParser(json);\n  // skip to first sub object -- **need to assume that the first is meta\nthough**\n  Meta meta = mapper.readValue(jp, Meta.class);\n  // look into the cost mode in meta and decide the ValueType;\n  // map is a pointer to the specific types\n  if (\"numerical\".equals(meta.costType.mode))\n    // one branch\n  else if\n    // another branch\n  ...\n\nI am not proposing the preceding change yet, but it may help to give\ncomments on the design choices--for example, the choice of map of map to\nObject instead of specific int or double.\n\nMake sense?\n\nRichard\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150422/61c548da/attachment.html>\n"

The code review link: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/18601 . However, the code logic for cost map and endpoint property map is not done yet since currently alto-commons does not support converting from rfc cost-map/endpoint property-map json to the one with yang model encoding, and vice versa (which means it only supports network-map now). Since kai is busy this week, I wrote the converter for the cost-map yesterday by myself but have not tested and pushed the code. I'm expecting to finish the endpoint property map part tonight.\n\n\nGreat!\n \nAfter that I will finalize alto-manger and then help with @xinli to write the test cases with robot framework. I'm expecting to finished all the test cases related to alto-manager this week.\n \nThanks. \n \nAlso, I had a long offline discussions with @xinwang about cost field of cost map. Things become a little complicated when it comes to cost field of cost map. If we use augmentation for cost field, alto-commons will depend on the project where the augmentation defined to convert cost-map json string to proper java object, that is to say, here, alto-commons is depending on alto-hosttracker. So could anyone code review and approve the code @xinwang just pushed last weekend so we could use his code?\n\n\nI will review tomorrow.\n\n \nAlso, although using the augmentation, i think defining a default cost field in alto-model is necessary. Currently what we did is just deleting the field from alto-model and defining it in some other projects by augmentation.\n\n\nLet me understand. What is a goal of defining a default cost field?

It depends on when Xin and Kai are available.\nXin/Kai: please let us know.\nLet me summarize the option, if we use yang (BTW: I always think using yang is a wrong design decision, because it does not add much free ride but add much restriction, at least for a programmer, :-(\nHere is the proposal: Base cost-map includes only meta; depends on cost-metric, we add (augment) the correct hash map. This is to simulate the inheritance design in my previous email (base class has only meta and each derived class has the correct HashMap of HashMap; note there is a typo in the previous email, which I fixed in this reply). I will take a look at Jackson to see how it handles such stateful parsing.\nI thought about a yang storage model where each cost value is always a float (this is allowed by the Java promotion rule), but it is a hack that will fall apart when we add vector.\nThanks.\nRichard \n\n\nOn Wednesday, April 22, 2015, ?? <dongs2011 at gmail.com> wrote:\nSorry for the late reply.

In particular, my understanding of the proposal is that the\ninterop should leave as much unspecified as possible. A first reaction then\nis how to validate the correctness. For example, the response of\nresource-id is not known ahead of time. I assume that then the interop\nparticipants will need a second channel (e.g., human in the loop) to verify\nthat a client c1 gets the correct response from a server s1. Is this the\nintended setting?\n\n2. A second comment is that it will be interesting if the interop design\nwill also become a starting point of ALTO compliance tests. We partition\nthe tests into MUST and optional so that a test case is a MUST case if and\nonly if (iff) it is a MUST in RFC7285. In the current proposal below, I see\nsome mix (e.g., some services in the interop is not a MUST in RFC7285).\nMake sense?\n\nRichard\n\nOn Fri, May 29, 2015 at 10:24 AM, Wendy Roome <w.roome at alcatel-lucent.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Folks,\n>\n> Rather than simply update the last test, I suggest a new approach,\n> outlined below.\n>\n> **** General ****\n>\n> The interop test defines two network maps: the default network map and an\n> alternate network map. We specify the PIDs and CIDRs for each map. For\n> each network map, the interop test defines the numerical-mode values for\n> the routingcost and hopcount cost-metrics. The interop test does not\n> define ordinal values for those metrics. Instead, each ALTO server may\n> assign ordinal values however it wants, as long as the ordinal values\n> preserve the numerical values.\n>\n> The interop test also defines a custom endpoint property, say\n> \"priv:ietf-type\", and specifies the values.\n>\n>\n> **** Approach & Philosophy ****\n>\n> Rather than specifying every detail, as in the previous interop test, this\n> iteration only specifies what is absolutely necessary. That is, the PIDs\n> in the network maps, the costs between PIDs, and the enpdoint property\n> values. Everything else -- resource ids, uris, cost-type names, etc. -- is\n> up to the server. Thus each server is completely characterized by two\n> parameters:\n>\n> * The URI of its IRD.\n> * The resource id of its alternate map (if provided).\n>\n> When a client is paired with a server, the client is given those two\n> parameters. The client is expected to determine everything else it needs\n> (e.g., the URIs of the default network map and the numerical routingcost\n> cost map) from the IRD.\n>\n> Client-writers are encouraged to script their client so that it validates\n> the server's responses. That is, rather than just printing a cost map, the\n> client is encouraged to verify that it has the expected values. The\n> interop test will specify the maps in enough detail that clients will know\n> exactly what the server should return for any request.\n>\n> Server-writers are encouraged to configure their server (especially the\n> IRD) so as to stress-test clients. That is, do things which are legal, but\n> unusual. For example, instead of having all resources in one IRD, the\n> server might have several linked (cascaded) IRDs. Or instead of offering\n> one filtered cost map, which handles all four combinations of cost metrics\n> & modes, plus constraints, the server might offer four separate filtered\n> cost map resources: one which handles numerical mode routingcost &\n> hopcount, but does not accept constraints, a second that handles the same\n> cost types, but which does accept constraints, and two more for ordinal\n> mode costs. This would verify that a client is able to select the correct\n> resource for a given request.\n>\n>\n> **** Server Requirements ****\n>\n> Each server MUST offer the following resources:\n> * A full network map for the default network.\n> * Four full cost maps for the default network map: the routingcost &\n> hopcount metrics, in both numerical & ordinal modes.\n> * An endpoint property service for the pid property for the default\n> network map.\n>\n> Each server MAY offer the following optional services:\n> * A filtered network map for the default network.\n> * A filtered cost map for the default network, optionally allowing cost\n> constraints.\n> * An endpoint cost service, covering the 4 cost metric/mode combinations,\n> optionally allowing cost constraints. The values must be derived from the\n> default network & cost maps.\n> * The filtered cost map & endpoint cost services may support constraints.\n> * An alternate network map plus the 4 associated full cost maps.\n> * An endpoint property service for the alternate network's pid property.\n> This may be the same EPS resource as for the default network, or a\n> different resource.\n> * A filtered network map for the alternate network.\n> * A filtered cost map for the alternate network map.\n>\n> If offered, the filtered cost map & endpoint cost resources MUST cover all\n> four metric/mode combinations.\n>\n> If offered, the costs for the endpoint cost service MUST must be derived\n> from the default network map.\n>\n>\n> **** Client Requirements ****\n>\n> When a client is paired with a server, the client is given the URI of the\n> server's IRD, and the resource id of its alternate map (if the server &\n> client support alternate maps). The client must be able to extract all\n> other information from the IRD -- full map resources, their URIs, etc.\n>\n> Each client MUST:\n>\n> * Fetch the IRD.\n> * Locate & fetch the default network map and its four associated full cost\n> maps.\n> * Locate the EPS for the default network map's pid resource, and determine\n> the pid for a set of endpoints specified by the interop test.\n>\n> Note that clients are not required to fetch the alternate network map (if\n> present). But every client must be able to parse an IRD with an alternate\n> network map, and distinguish the default network map, and its associate\n> resources, from the alternate map.\n>\n> Optional client requirements:\n> * Use the filtered network map for the default network map to fetch PIDs\n> specified by the interop test.\n> * Use the filtered cost map for the default network map to fetch the costs\n> for several combinations of source pids, destination pids, metrics/modes,\n> and optional constraints, as specified by the interop test.\n> * Use the endpoint cost service to fetch the costs for several\n> combinations of source addresses, destination addresses, metrics/modes,\n> and optional constraints, as specified by the interop test.\n> * Locate & fetch the alternate map and its four full cost maps.\n> * Use the filtered network map for the alternate network map to fetch PIDs\n> specified by the interop test.\n> * Use the filtered cost map for the alternate network map to fetch the\n> costs for several combinations of source pids, destination pids,\n> metrics/modes, and optional constraints, as specified by the interop test.\n> * Fetch the custom endpoint property for a set of endpoints defined by the\n> interop test.\n>\n>\n> **** Error Testing ****\n>\n> We will develop \"torture test\" scripts of bad client requests, and feed\n> them to each server to make sure the server gives reasonable error\n> responses. Participants are encouraged to contribute bad client requests\n> up to the time of the test. We will not specify the error tests in\n> advance, but will publish them after the interop is complete.\n>\n> Note that the emphasis in on verifying that servers survive client errors.\n> It does not seem important to verify that clients survive server errors.\n> If you disagree, speak now or forever hold your peace.\n>\n>     - Wendy Roome\n>\n>\n> _______________________________________________\n> alto mailing list\n> alto at ietf.org\n>\n> https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.ietf.org_mailman_listinfo_alto&d=AwICAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=4G36iiEVb2m_v-0RnP2gx9KZJjYQgfvrOCE3789JGIA&m=kXIGnWFHVmEKkrU-3jzE_hUpglOe7Bj7H4Ys164dZBE&s=eXl0C-Yj1ZVYLA6lRFfpWyP1zKA5InHCoayBzITypGQ&e=\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150529/1d80d107/attachment.html>\n"

ALTO costs represent\ncommunication links, and are potentially asymmetric. Eg,  the download\nbandwidth can be higher than the upload bandwidth.\n\n* For a metric, d(x,x) = 0 for all x. For ALTO, the cost within a PID\nfrequently is greater than 0.\n\n* For a metric, d(x,y) = 0 means x = y. We *might* be able to define ALTO\ncosts so that is possible, but I have my doubts.\n\n* For a metric, d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z) for all y. For ALTO, that is\ntempting requirement, and I cannot think of an obvious counter example. But\nI doubt that would help without the other requirements.\n\nSo we could not require *every* ALTO cost metric to qualify as a\nmathematical metric. But we could define a particular cost as satisfying\nthose rules, and (say) identify it in the IRD.  Can you explain how that\nwould benefit clients or servers? One obvious advantage is that the cost\nmatrix could be smaller, because its symmetric and the center diagonal is 0.\n\n- Wendy Roome\n\nFrom:  \"Bertz, Lyle T [CTO]\" <Lyle.T.Bertz at sprint.com>\nDate:  Fri, May 29, 2015 at 16:03\nTo:  Wendy Roome <w.roome at alcatel-lucent.com>, \"Y.

Richard Yang\nCc: alto at ietf.org; Bertz, Lyle T [CTO]; Hans Seidel; alto-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [alto] Interop test\n\nI thought RFC 7285 required order-consistency between numerical & ordinal modes for the same metric. But I cannot find that requirement. Too bad! I would have added that if I realized it wasn't there.\n\nBut if we take off our lawyer hats, and look at RFC 7285 as an agreement between friends, rather than a formal contract between adversaries, then I think it is reasonable to say that if the ordinal mode costs do not preserve the order of the numerical costs, then that server is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, a router is allowed to drop packets, and I do not think there is any formal requirement that it cannot drop *every* packet. So theoretically you could glue eight jacks to a block of hardwood and market it as a router. Maybe you could avoid getting charged for fraud. Just don't expect anyone to buy more than one! :-)\n\nAnd looking at it from a real-world perspective, the whole concept is irrelevant. The only reason for defining ordinal mode is to allow a server to hide the numerical costs. For example, if the numerical costs to three PIDs are 10, 11 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is close. If the costs are 10, 99 and 100, a client can deduce that the middle pid is distant. If the ordinal costs are 1,2,3, a client cannot deduce anything other than 1 is better than 2 is better than 3.\n\nSo if a server offers numerical costs, there is no advantage for it to also offer ordinal mode costs.\n\nAnd if numerical costs are available, there is no advantage to a client to use ordinal costs. Maybe if the client could assume the ordinal costs are 1,2,3,... -- but the client cannot.\n\nSo in practice, no server will offer both numerical & ordinal mode for the same metric.\n\nThat means a formal compliance test should only require one mode or the other, but not both. However, keep the interop simple, unless someone objects, I suggest we require both modes.\n\n                - Wendy\n\nFrom: \"Y.

An issue is that RFC7285 specifies only that \"An ALTO server MUST support at least one of the following modes:  numerical and ordinal.\" I believe that RFC7285 chose to not specify the consistency between the two modes. Hence, this is beyond compliance, right? Hence, I feel that separating RFC7285-conforming and beyond can be helpful.\n\n________________________________\n\nThis e-mail may contain Sprint proprietary information intended for the sole use of the recipient(s).

I think such a standard, which\ndecouples the development of ALTO servers and information sources, would\nbe beneficial in the long run.\n\n\nBut private protocols can still exist for certain implementations.  \nActually they can easily extend the protocol by replacing 'type' and\n'source' with some private values and filling the 'data' field in their\nown format.\n\nRegards,\nKai\n\nOn 03/07/15 09:55, Y.

Assume that there are several paths for data transfer computed initially at SDN controller, and path can not be set anymore after even the network becomes congested.

Finally, ALTO server collects the current network state, and finds the cost has been updated.\n\nHowever, it would become complex when the SDN controller can set new paths for applications requirements. The controller can move the data flows from the original path to the new one, or only makes new data flows transmit through new paths.

We assume no multicast.\n\nTo see how each module is implemented by network and/or by application,\nconsider what is network state. In a current, typical OF setting, the\nnetwork switches will have flow tables and ovsdb, which implement routing\n(M2) and queueing (M3). Hence, we have the following implementation options:\nM1: app\nM2: net\nM3: app and/or net\n\nSo far, the main focus of ALTO is on providing info from network to app for\nthe app to implement M1. The recent effort on path vector starts to help\nproviding  info from network to app for the app to implement M3.\n\nNow, suppose SDN becomes widely used, and hence app may have an\n(north-bound) API to influence M2 (e.g., a first API might be PCEP like\nAPI). This will create control feedback, and hence a key issue for ALTO\nthen is what the interactions might look like. IETF does not define\nalgorithms but can provide guidance on the architecture.\n\nCheers,\nRichard\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150715/34bdf9cd/attachment.html>\n"

        "body": {
            "plain": "Hi Tamim and Richard,\n\nHere is how we compute the ECS now. We get the routing path from source\nhost to dest host first, and then compute the endpoint cost according to\nthe routing path and cost metric (e.g. bandwidth, hopcount).\n\nComputing routing path in ODL is the core of the design and the details are\nexplained as follows:\n1. We get the attachment points of source host and dest host, let's call it\nstart_switch and end_switch, by L2Switch.\n2. We read flow table of start_switch and find the matched flow entry\naccording to src host IP and dst host IP. If matched flow entry is found,\nwe get next switch from the flow entry, then we repeat this step to chase\nnext switch until we get to end_switch.\n4. If there is no matched flow entry, we will force ODL controller to\ncompute a new routing path, by either invoking the path computing function\nor sending a fake packet. Once the path computing is done, we repeat step 2\nuntil we get to end_switch.\n\nIn this way, we get the routing path. Following is the pseudo code:\n\n>\n> sw_id = get_attachment_point(src)\n>\ndst_sw_id = get_attachment_point(dst)\n\nwhile (sw_id != dst_sw_id) {\n\n  r <- loop_up(src, dst) in sw_id's flow table\n\n  if (!r) {\n>     forceComputeRoutingPath(src, dst)\n>     r <- loop_up(src, dst) in sw_id's flow table\n\n  }\n>\n  sw_id = get_sw_id(r)\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nOnce we get the routing path, we can compute endpoint costs based on\ndifferent cost metrics. Hopcount is easy to compute while bandwidth is a\nlittle more complicated since we have to get the bandwidth of each link at\nfirst.\n\n@Richard The following is what we have done during the past three days:\n1. Get attachment point of host by host IP address. Done. (Shu, Xiao)\n2. Look up flow table to get matching flow entry and next switch. Almost\nDone. (Xiao, Shu)\n3. Figure out how to force ODL controller to compute routing path. In\nprogress. (Mingming)\n4. Setting up a mininet + controller test environment in our lab. (Junzhuo,\nXiao)\n5. Some code refactoring. (Shu)\n\nThings left to be done:\n1. Figure out how to force ODL controller to compute routing path.\n2. Figure out how to get bandwidth of each link.\n3. Combine all the parts together.\n\n>From tomorrow, we will focus on left problems. Mingming has made some\nprogress in the first one but it will be great if we have someone else to\nhelp.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nFrom,\nShu\n\n\nOn Sat, Aug 1, 2015 at 11:55 PM, Y.

You can check their wiki and eventually drop a question to their mailing list. Also you can read the topology and compute by yourself.\n\n\nRegards,\n\"\nI don't know how it goes now(I missed sync up on Saturday). I will try to find Dijkstra algorithm in ODL.

I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.\n\n\nBut in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.\n\n\nThanks!\nJunzhuo\n\n\n\n\nThe Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them.

            "plain": "To add a bit, according to my understanding:\n- current l2switch uses flooding based on a single, shared spanning. Hence,\nassume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k\nrules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1\nneighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing\nECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst\npair is the same.\n\n- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority\nflow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from\nthe tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that\nthis may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:\n* We identify compression.\n* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules.\nThey are triggered by packet-in only.\n* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively\nshort timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.\n\n- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path\nto an l3 path.\n\nIn the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP\nreroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on\nl2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition\napproach of ODL.\n\nRichard\n\nOn Sunday, August 9, 2015, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi Mingming,\n>\n> The current status is that Dijkstra algorithm is not be used in l2switch.\n> The related code are all been annotated.

Hence, assume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k rules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1 neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst pair is the same.\n\n- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:\n* We identify compression.\n* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules. They are triggered by packet-in only.\n* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively short timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.\n\n- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path to an l3 path.\n\nIn the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP reroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on l2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition approach of ODL.\n\nRichard\n\nOn Sunday, August 9, 2015, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com<mailto:wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com>> wrote:\nHi Mingming,\n\nThe current status is that Dijkstra algorithm is not be used in l2switch. The related code are all been annotated. And the authors of l2switch also says this module is not complete. Instead, it use STP to forward all packets to every devices in the network. So we decide to develop our own module ?l2switch-plus? to enhance the ability of l2switch. As a result, we can get routing information easily.\n\nBest regards,\nJunzhuo\n\n\nHi all,\nI am sorry to come back so late. I sent email to cisco's stuff last Tuesday.

Is there a layer 3 routing module could make OpenFlow switcher acts like a traditional router?\n\nThanks!\nJunzhuo\n\n\nHi Evan,\n\nIt great to have your reply! I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.\n\nBut in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.\n\nThanks!\nJunzhuo\n\n\nThe Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them. FlowWriterServiceImpl.java in l2switch-main may have what you're looking for, it can create mac to mac flows, I'm not sure how robust the functionality is at the moment.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 6, 2015 at 9:14 AM, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com<javascript:_e(%7B%7D,'cvml','wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com');>> wrote:\nHi Andr?,\n\nThanks a lot for your reply!

            "plain": "Hi Danny,\n\nI just notice that the version of odl-alto-provider you used is\n0.2.0-SNAPSHOT, so I guess that you were using the latest *master* branch\ncode in the ODL gerrit, right? This branch is unstable, and still has some\nbugs which are not fixed by us. So I suggest you try the *stable/lithium*\nbranch, and I think the odl-alto-provider feature can work well in this\nbranch. Also, we will fix bugs and make master branch work as soon as\npossible.

Now I am using the\nSTABLE/LITHIUM branch and I already have available\nhttp://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html. Now, I will continue\ntesting some others ALTO Features and any other question or problem I will\nwrite. We at University of Campinas are developing a proof of concept of\nALTO server implementation (for IXP-related use cases) based on Neo4j graph\nDB and OpenDaylight.\n\nSo once again, many thanks.\n\nSs\n\nDanny\n\nps: I think that the manual (\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1nx2U5WvVlCU-dierN-EF9L5iAzRrNNr1S73EzsSjAmo/edit#)\ncould be updated because It is not clearly specified what kind of branch\nshould be downloaded.\n\n\nOn Fri, Aug 21, 2015 at 1:19 PM, Jensen Zhang <jingxuan.n.zhang at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hi Danny,\n>\n> I just notice that the version of odl-alto-provider you used is\n> 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT, so I guess that you were using the latest *master* branch\n> code in the ODL gerrit, right? This branch is unstable, and still has some\n> bugs which are not fixed by us. So I suggest you try the *stable/lithium*\n> branch, and I think the odl-alto-provider feature can work well in this\n> branch.

            "plain": "Hi Danny,\n\nProjects in OpenDaylight use OSGi framework, and they need to be installed\nin karaf as features [1].\n\nBecause you introduce a new package into alto-northbound, you have to add\nnew bundles or features in the 'odl-alto-northbound' feature. (It will be\nlocated in 'features/src/main/features/features.xml' or\n'features/src/main/resources/features.xml'.)\n\nBut for your problem, I don't suggest you use *org.codehaus.jackson* in\nalto-northbound, unless necessary. Because:\n\n1. You can use com.fasterxml.jackson.core [2], since this is a newer\njackson implementation than org.codehaus.jackson. And we have imported\nbundles for this into alto-commons which is an dependency of\nalto-northbound, so you can just repleace the dependency declaration in\nalto-northbound by this new one.\n2. But you'd better not use jackson in northbound module. It is just a\nfront-end and it should not implement any complex logic. You can implement\nyour functions in alto-services or alto-provider. For example, the\nimplementation of 'getNetworkMap' is in\n'alto-services/provider/simple-alto/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/alto/services/provider/simple/SimpleAltoService.java'.\n\nHope this is helpful to you.\n\n---\n\n[1] https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Karaf:Step_by_Step_Guide\n[2] http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonRelease20\n\nThanks,\nJensen\n\n2015-08-28 4:44 GMT+08:00 Danny Alex Lachos Perez <dlachosper at gmail.com>:\n\n> Hi Jensen,\n>\n> I have a problem when I want to use the \"jackson\" library in my ALTO\n> project.\n>\n> I am modifying the alto-Northbound project, I am adding a few code lines:\n>\n> =======================================================\n> In pox file of alto-Northbound project I added:\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *<dependency>      <groupId>org.codehaus.jackson</groupId>\n> <artifactId>jackson-core-asl</artifactId>\n> <version>1.9.7</version>              </dependency>*\n>\n> in imports add:\n>\n>\n> *org.codehaus.jackson.jackson-core-asl.**\n> ========================================================\n> In Java code (AltoNorthbound.java), I added:\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> *import org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode;...JsonNode rows =\n> response.getEntity(JsonNode.class);*\n> ============================================================\n>\n> The error is:\n>\n>\n>\n> *java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/codehaus/jackson/JsonNode    at\n> org.opendaylight.alto.northbound.AltoNorthbound.REST_Query(AltoNorthbound.java:234)\n> at\n> org.opendaylight.alto.northbound.AltoNorthbound.retrieveNetworkMap(AltoNorthbound.java:166)*\n> ========================================================\n>\n> Ss\n>\n> Danny\n>\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150828/bd087f8c/attachment.html>\n"

And we may have multiply meetings\nwith their dev team to talk about their requirements and our limitations in\nnext week (7th to 13th). Then we can quickly iterate our ECS design in the\nfollowing two weeks (14th to 27th). Finally we may give a final version to\nLenovo in the week of National Day.\n\nBest regards,\nJunzhuo\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150903/6e578288/attachment.html>\n"

If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include\nGuohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?\n\n  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.\n\n3.

Proposal: Add Kai,  Shu, Jensen, as new committers.\n\n   Justification (copy from Kai's summary):\n   \"Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.\"\n\n  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1\n\n2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:\n\n   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?\n\n  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.\n\n3. Proposal: Add Junzhuo as a new committer after new ALTO version check in.\n\n  Vote: Pending Junzhuo check in.\n\n4. Remove Xiao from the committers, as Xiao no longer participates in the ALTO project.\n\n  Vote: +1\n\nPlease share your opinions when you can.\n\nThanks.\nRichard\n\n[1] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/project:alto+owner:jensenzhang\n[2] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/owner:gaok12%40mails.tsinghua.edu.cn+status:merged+project:alto\n[3] https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/owner:dongshu+status:merged+project:alto\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Y.

Proposal: Add Kai,  Shu, Jensen, as new committers.\n\n   Justification (copy from Kai's summary):\n   \"Jensen has submitted a lot of commits on improving the code quality [1] by writing tests and fixing bugs and he is now a key member of the development team. Kai ans Shu have implemented most components of ALTO Lithium release [2, 3].  They are also the actual project leaders of this project currently.\"\n\n  Vote (please vote +1, 0, -1). My vote is +1\n\n2. Proposal: Add Guohai as a new committer after ALTO client check in:\n\n   Justification: Guohai has made substantial contribution to write an ALTO client. If we  check in as part of the ALTO project, we should include Guohai (Robert) as a committer. Robert: Do you want to do so?\n\n  Vote: Pending Guohai check in.\n\n3.

I will try to make\nthat clearer.\n\nI would have loved to send the stop-updates on the same stream. But I don't\nthink that is compatible with HTTP 1.1. The de-facto convention is that the\nclient sends all its data first, then the server sends its response. While\nthe HTTP 1.1 spec might let us squeak around that, I think most HTTP client\nlibraries and HTTP server frameworks enforce that convention, so a client or\nserver might have to do their own HTTP implementation. That would make it\nmuch harder to adopt the extension.\n\nAs for a load-balanced server pool, the server which gets the stop-updates\nrequest is responsible for forwarding it to the appropriate server. For\nexample, the stream-id could have the id of the specific server. The server\nwhich gets stop-updates simply sends a side-channel cease-and-desist order\nto the server handling the update stream, and then replies to the client.\nNote that this is a simple reply, not a HTTP redirect or some sort of TCP\nreconnection.\n> \n> - Sec. 6.3: a small typo \"stop-update\" -> \"stop-updates\" in the third\n> paragraph.

But that means a server cannot use * as a resource id\n(granted, I doubt that will bother anyone). Also, I suspect most users will\nwant to stop all updates. I included the selective-stop for logical\ncompleteness.\n\nSo I have no problem with an empty array meaning stop-all.\n\nI have not seen anything defining a command structure on top of SSE.\n> \n> Thanks.\n> Richard\n> \n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20150924/4c2d04f0/attachment.html>\n"

That is a\nserver requirement, so it seems that section is a better fit.\n\n- Wendy\n\nFrom:  <yang.r.yang at gmail.com> on behalf of \"Y.

It helps. I believe\nthat it will be removed at the final stage.\n\n- Sec. 4.3: Why not use the empty event keep-alive. Does an empty event\nstill indicate a keep alive? (xref target ) seems to be missing <\n\n- Sec. 6: It looks to me that it is adding some command structure in the\nUpdate Stream Service. Does it help to say a few words on why in the bullet\nitem about it in Sec. 3? Initially, I thought we assume a persistent\nconnection setting where the client can continue to turn on and off the\nupdate streams by sending multiple requests in the same TCP connection. When\nreading the 3rd para of Sec. 6.3.2, it is not fully clear. Is it a new\nconnection or the same connection? If a new connection, then due to load\nbalancing, the request may not go to the same ALTO server.\n\n- Sec. 6.3: a small typo \"stop-update\" -> \"stop-updates\" in the third\nparagraph. Also, it uses a default all semantics. Thinking a bit about it, I\ntied \"ls\" under a directory. It shows all. But \"rm\" says that it is an\nerror. Another piece of thought. I wonder if SSE itself does not have a\ncommand structure. \n\nThanks.\nRichard\n\nOn Wed, Sep 23, 2015 at 3:10 PM, Wendy Roome <w.roome at alcatel-lucent.com>\nwrote:\n> Richard,\n> \n> Did you have a chance to read the revised incremental update draft?\n> \n> I implemented Update Streams as described in -02, and pushed it out to our\n> public ALTO server for testing.

Hence, assume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k rules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1 neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst pair is the same.\n\n- As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:\n* We identify compression.\n* Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules. They are triggered by packet-in only.\n* Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively short timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.\n\n- In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path to an l3 path.\n\nIn the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP reroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on l2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition approach of ODL.\n\nRichard\n\nOn Sunday, August 9, 2015, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com<mailto:wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com>> wrote:\nHi Mingming,\n\nThe current status is that Dijkstra algorithm is not be used in l2switch.

Is there a layer 3 routing module could make OpenFlow switcher acts like a traditional router?\n\nThanks!\nJunzhuo\n\n\nHi Evan,\n\nIt great to have your reply! I?ve seen that the method ?addBidirectionalMacToMacFlows? calls ?addMacToMacFlow? twice. Based on the code, I assume in this implementation, the STP eliminate loops so all packets can be forwarded to all switchers. So only two flow entries could build a path between two MAC addresses.\n\nBut in my test, the MAC to MAC flow only be built when two hosts connected to the same switcher. This phenomenon really confuses me. I?m looking forward to your reply.\n\nThanks!\nJunzhuo\n\n\nThe Minimum Spanning Tree is calculated to prevent loops in the network, those links that receive STP blocking status won't have flows written on them. FlowWriterServiceImpl.java in l2switch-main may have what you're looking for, it can create mac to mac flows, I'm not sure how robust the functionality is at the moment.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 6, 2015 at 9:14 AM, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com> wrote:\nHi Andr?,\n\nThanks a lot for your reply!

Hence, assume a switch with k neighbors in the spanning tree, it needs only k rules in its flow table: for each incoming neighbor, flood to the other k-1 neighbors. If we use the number of links traversed as cost when computing ECS, this routing scheme is not useful, because the cost for each arc-dst pair is the same. \n> \n> - As a first step, we develop l2switch-plus, which adds higher priority flow rules: for a given src, dst MAC pairs, we find the unicast path from the tree, and add <src-Mac, dst-Mac> entries to the flow tables. Note that this may cause flow table explosion, which we can look into:\n> * We identify compression. \n> * Another idea is that when computing ECS, we do not insert the Mac rules. They are triggered by packet-in only. \n> * Yet another idea is that ECS will insert the rules but with a relatively short timeout. Hence those rules not used by app will timeout quickly.\n> \n> - In the next step, we use the ip-mac binding table to convert an l2 path to an l3 path.\n> \n> In the long run, the preceding is not complete. For example, what if GBP reroutes a flow through middle boxes. The preceding derivation based on l2switch routing is not correct. We need to look into the composition approach of ODL.\n> \n> Richard\n> \n> On Sunday, August 9, 2015, Junzhuo Wang <wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com <mailto:wangjunzhuo200 at gmail.com>> wrote:\n> Hi Mingming,\n> \n> The current status is that Dijkstra algorithm is not be used in l2switch.

            "plain": "Hi Azher,\n\nSorry for the delay. I modified the L2Switch not for fixing bugs, but for\nimproving it. The original L2Switch uses spinning tree to flood every\npacket on the network, which is not effective. And ODL does not have a\nservice to provide routing information. So basically what I did is:\n\n1. Replace spin tree with shortest path algorithm to build a p2p flow\nbetween two hosts;\n2. Add APIs to provide routing information.\n\nAn issue is that openflow-plugin, a module what L2Switch depends on, has\nsome bugs. So L2Switch may not compact with every switch. I'll try to solve\nyour problem by reading the spec of Dell Z9100 and the docs of\nopenflow-plugin.\n\nRegards,\nAustin (Junzhuo)\n\n\n2015-10-10 9:26 GMT+08:00 Y.

An alternative us to provide tags to\nswitches. For example, the nearest-anchor call only defines the network map\nname and the names of pids. We have an API to allow assign tags to switch:\nsw1 -> netmap1:pid2, netmap3:pid10\n\nIn a sense we provide a map management API, which allows create maps,\ndefines the grouping algorithm (e.g., nearest-anchor), and tag switches, ...\n\nNote that link based partition can be interesting as well.\n\nRichard\n\n\n>  Richard\n>\n>    \"cost-map-cal-alg\": \"avg\"   // cost from pid1 (sw1 cluster) to pid2\n>> (sw2 cluster) is the average of host pairs\n>> }\n>> Then we can see that it defines three PIDs, where each PID is defined by\n>> an anchor in anchors.

            "plain": "It may make sense for some of us to take a look at NetJSON. Wendy gave a\nthorough response, and some of us may want to take a close look as well.\n\nRichard\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\nFrom: Wendy Roome <w.roome at alcatel-lucent.com>\nDate: Mon, Sep 21, 2015 at 10:50 AM\nSubject: Re: NetJSON and ALTO\nTo: alto at ietf.org\nCc: hrogge at gmail.com, aaron at lo-res.org, \"Y. Richard Yang\" <yry at cs.yale.edu>,\nmanet at ietf.org, nemesis at ninux.org\n\n\nThanks for letting the ALTO group know about NetJSON. NetJSON is related\nto the proposed ALTO extensions to describe network topology. However, I\nthink ALTO's needs are sufficiently different, and sufficiently simpler,\nthat there is no advantage using NetJSON in ALTO.\n\nThe proposed ALTO topology extensions give clients a very simple, abstract\nview of the network so that clients can determine how much the paths\nbetween endpoints overlap. E.g., suppose a client wants to do parallel\nbackups to two different cloud servers. If the paths to servers A & B have\nmany common elements, while the paths to servers A & C do not, the client\nwould prefer to use A & C.\n\nALTO could use the NetJSON NetworkGraph sub-schema to describe topology,\nbut that is considerably more complicated than what we have proposed. For\nexample, a NetworkGraph has nodes, links that connect nodes, and\ndescriptions of routing protocols. The front-runner for describing\ntopology in ALTO is to provide a list of abstract network elements\ninvolved in the path between two endpoint clusters. The elements can be\nnodes, links, or combinations of those. A NetJSON NetworkGraph is\nconsiderably more complicated, and much closer to the physical network.\n\nAlso, ALTO clients are typically enduser applications with minimal\nknowledge of network internals. They want ALTO to hide the details and\ngive them just what the need, and no more. So few ALTO clients would need\nthe rest of NetJSON, and forcing them to learn it would just make it\nharder to use ALTO. Similarly, I doubt that NetJSON libraries would\nsimplify ALTO clients; it would just mean a client has to learn how to\nturn off features the client will never use.\n\n        - Wendy Roome\n\n>Date: Mon, 14 Sep 2015 10:05:31 +0000\n>From: Rick Taylor <rick at tropicalstormsoftware.com>\n>To: Henning Rogge <hrogge at gmail.com>, \"L.

The feedback from you is great\nfor the ALTO project to improve. At the same time, we apology for the\ninaccuracies and hence the issues caused.\n\nHere is my proposal to move forward:\n1. We will first go over the issues discovered by you in your email, one by\none, to verify and proposal fixes; please give us two days;\n2. After 1., we want to schedule a meet up with you to go over the issues\nwith you and work together; I believe that no one is more motivated than us\nto fix the issues;\n3. After 2., we will send a summary to Phil and others on what both ALTO\nand other ODL project can learn to improve.\n\nHow does the preceding sound?\nRichard\n\nOn Sunday, November 1, 2015, Jensen Zhang <jingxuan.n.zhang at gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> I agree with Junzhuo (Austin).

I will put them on our supercomputing\nwebsite soon.\n\nIf you notice we have a mix of hardware from various vendors, however\nonly Dell and Brocade will be part of the OF topology. Mellanox spectrum\ndoes not support OF yet.\n\nIn the Interconnect diagram you will see the various hosts which will be\ndedicated to different demos, so that people running those demos will\nhave free hand to continue their demos. I can dedicate few more machines\nwhere ALTO can be demonstrated, we need to ensure that everything will\nwork involving ALTO.\n\nIf you/team need early access to test/install any particular software in\nthe testbed environment, please send me your keys and your source IP\naddresses.\n\nI am also available at \"626.318.0100 \" for any quick call.\n\nThanks\n-Azher\n\nOn 11/2/2015 11:46 AM, Y.

            "plain": "Azher, all,\n\nThanks a lot for the nice demo and the discussions. It is very helpful!\n\nThe ALTO team had some more internal discussions, based on our discussions\nlast night. Here is an outline:\n\n====\nEntities:\n- Endhost: Each endhost will have a data directory, which hosts the files\nthat it\n  has, for example, file1, file2, file3, ...\n- File tracker: There is a file tracker which keeps track of the files that\neach\n  endhost has as a map: <endhost> -> <list of files>\n- Scheduler: There is a scheduler which accepts transfer tasks and\nschedules\n  the transfers\n- ODL SDN controller\n\nProcesses:\n- Endhost: There is an agent running on each endhost to monitor the\nexisting\n  files and update the file tracker on the file index; The endhost tracker\nwill also\n  ping each other to get latency and report the results to the ALTO server\nin\n  the SDN controller; The agent (or a remote command) can start a file\ntransfer.\n\n- File tracker: accepts\n  queries on files available at each endhost, and\n  posts to update the file index\n\n- Scheduler: Schedule the transfers, where each transfer has the following\n  attributes: client-endpoint, file-name, priority, deadline. In\nparticular, the frontend\n  (or API) has a form to allow others to submit transfer requests; The\nbackend will\n  query the network status and compute the scheduling of transfers.\n\nDetails of the scheduling backend to schedule a set of transfers. Assume\nthat all\nthe transfers are given in a batch (T1, T2, ... TK) for the demo.\n- Query File tracker to obtain the replicas of the each data in the batch\n- Query ALTO to obtain the routing path for each T1(file).replica:\npath(T1(client),\n  T1(file).replica)\n- Query ALTO to obtain the path properties such as latency of the routing\npaths\n- Conduct scheduling (i.e., replica selection and maximum flow based for\ndeadline\nand priority), based on estimating TCP throughput (based on TCP throughput\nformula; the throughput of each flow is inverse proportional to its latency)\n- Issue transfer commands to the endhosts.\n\nIt looks like that some of your packages (e.g., MoniLisa) can be used for\nthe\npreceding. We are looking into.\n====\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 3, 2015 at 5:20 PM, Azher Mughal <azher at hep.caltech.edu> wrote:\n\n> Hi Richard,\n>\n> Likewise. My id is \"azheramin\". I just added your skype id.

An example is\nthis page:\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Toaster_Tutorial\n\nPretty much nobody uses those templates.

This will produce a directory in your project root called \"target/staged-site\". The string -Dstream can be set to anything, it just represents what version of your site documentation you want to call it. Typically Jenkins will use our release names such as -Dstream=beryllium or -Dstream=boron etc...\nYou can now open the site with your webbrowser by opening any of the html files for example:\n    google-chrome target/staged-site/index.html\nHope this helps,Thanh\nOn 25 February 2016 at 08:31, Xiao Lin <linxiao9292 at outlook.com> wrote:\n\n\n\nHi Thanh,\nI have followed the steps here [0] to automatically generate Maven Site.

To help in this process\nOpenFlow Plugin has created an unmerged patch which swaps the default\ndesign to the? \n???new? ???\nLithium design. The patch\nis:? *https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/35892.? *The purpose of\nthis patch is for projects to? identify issues in the migration and help\nOpenFlow Plugin fix them.? \n\nTo use this patch projects should:\n1.? \nclone the openflowplugin and then checkout this patch\n? it locally\n??? and build\n2.? \n??????\nt\n???est???\n? \n???their project with the locally swapped new plugin? \n\nWe would like this activity to identify issues to conclude in the next 2\nweeks or so (say? March 24? - which happens to be the current offset 2\nprojects M1 date in the provisional traditional release plan ). That way\nOpenFlow Plugin can factor the gaps needed to fix in the OpenFlow Plugin\nrelease plan which is due by M2 for us (current date in the provisional\ntraditional release plan for OFP is? April 21). The OFP target for\nfixing the issues and actually changing the default plugin would likely\nbe either OFP M2 or M3 - depending on the complexity of the issues\nidentified. The issues which cannot be worked around? \n???and? blocking development of the project? ???\nshould be raised as blocker issues on OpenFlow Plugin.\n\nAgain as I mentioned - please try this patch out and let us know the\nissues by? March 24. If there is an issue in providing this info -\nplease let us know as well.\n\n\nThanks,\nAbhijit\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20160311/04b0d4aa/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\n_______________________________________________\nrelease mailing list\nrelease at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/release\n"

            "plain": "Thanks Kai,\n\nIn case it helps the workflow most OpenDaylight projects use is, when a\ncommitter accepts and merges a patch, they make a decision if the patch\nneeds to be cherry-picked to other branches as well. For example if you a\nmerging a patch that was submitted to master you should decide if that\npatch needs to be backported to stable/beryllium and/or stable/lithium as\nwell at that time, typically this decision is done by the committer who\nreviews and merges the patch. The best way to do this is to use the\nCherry-pick button right inside Gerrit. Choose cherry-pick and enter the\nbranch you'd like to carry the patch over to, most of the time this should\nwork trivially. If you get an error then you'll need to do it manually via\ngit commandline as there is likely some merge conflicts you need to take\ncare of.\n\nIf you cherry-pick at time of merge it will save you a lot of effort of\nporting patches to new branches as your code is kept in sync. Typically you\nshould cherry-pick bug fixes backwards to stable branches and only pull in\nnew features to master branch but that is up to your project.\n\nAnother thing I highly recommend all committers review and understand is\nthis blog post regarding how to write well formed commit messages.\n\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n\nThis is an excellently written blog post about the importance of writing\ncommit messages that are meaningful and useful. If you've never had to\ntroubleshoot and debug code you may not realize the usefulness but commit\nmessages are immensely useful when you are troubleshooting and trying to\nfind which patch introduced a regression in your code. If you need examples\nof really well written commit message, the Linux Kernel project is one of\nthe best source of commit messages since they are extremely strict on only\naccepting patches that have well formed commit messages.\n\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master\n\nHope this helps,\nThanh\n\n\nOn 23 March 2016 at 22:04, Gao Kai <gaok12 at mails.tsinghua.edu.cn> wrote:\n\n> Thanh Ha,\n>\n> Thanks for the help and I apologize for not responding earlier.

The main motivation for this is\nfor better upgrade support and usability wrt to the config system (CSS).\n\nThe plan is to merge the above patch within the next few days. The\nmd-sal services are provided via blueprint (as OSGi services) and also\nvia the CSS. So apps will continue work as is using the CSS. The core\nblueprint support enables apps to use blueprint for code wiring in lieu\nof the CSS.\n\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Using_Blueprint outlines how to use\nblueprint in ODL apps.\n\nOnce this patch is merged, if there are any issues, please respond to\nthis email.\n\nTom\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20160425/80a12666/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\n_______________________________________________\nrelease mailing list\nrelease at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/release\n\n"

I'm not familiar with DLUX, so I cannot give more suggestions. If you want to improve DLUX, you can contact DLUX team to talk about more details. I believe they will be happy for your contribution. :)\n\nBest,\nJensen\n\nOn Thu, Apr 28, 2016 at 12:19 PM, <karthikeyan.d17 at wipro.com<mailto:karthikeyan.d17 at wipro.com>> wrote:\n\nHi Team ,\n\n\n Myself karthik , working in ODL.I have a questions. Please help me!.\n\n\nWhen I am giving iperf or ping between two hosts , I need to check the network speed (rate at which data is traveling) in each link.For example you could see the ONOS UI , It will show you the data speed in each link.\n\n\nSo I think In ODL DLUX-UI we dont have that kind of stuffs. I would like to develop that. I need your help. From where can i get the details of rate of speed? L2switch or OpenflowPlugin project or anything else? Give me some idea I will do it.\n\n\nThanks,\n\n-Karthik\n\nThe information contained in this electronic message and any attachments to this message are intended for the exclusive use of the addressee(s) and may contain proprietary, confidential or privileged information.

I've had a few\nfolks send me mappings of their ODLID / bugzilla account to LFID and\nColin asked if there was a survey / form to fill out. Given that I think\nthat's an excellent idea I've created one [0].\n\nWhy are we asking for this information? If we don't then we don't have a\ngood way of making sure that issues in JIRA get properly assigned to\npeople as the issues come over from Bugzilla.\n\nSecondly, this data will also help us when we do our Gerrit migration to\nLFID as it will allow us to more efficiently unblock / remap accounts in\nthe system.\n\nOur ask is you fill out this form before next week, October 19 as we are\npresently planning on migrating Bugzilla to JIRA on the 20th. For the\nvery few of you that have already sent information in, if I could ask\nthat you go ahead and fill out the form as well it will make it a lot\neasier to deal with instead of having to merge information from several\ndifferent emails.\n\n-Andy-\n\n[0] https://goo.gl/forms/kFNYZ9nTASNsqYhT2\n\n--\nAndrew J Grimberg\nLead, IT Release Engineering\nThe Linux Foundation\n\n_______________________________________________\nTSC mailing list\nTSC at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/tsc\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/alto-dev/attachments/20171015/af9b0b65/attachment.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v2\n\niQEcBAEBCgAGBQJZ34fJAAoJEGVJAqpij5euBg0H/1vdUxOQwuUTv9lBEjO4Msgs\nex+wuCVZxUP8PJO77Cc0UBSoiBmtGRNSNtH8vld49p71vUhyeSa9YR1+f1wVEQ45\nx/uXaxzojuAhBlFRy7CZeUBs+yaxSecCwIc1H69Mj1srKO6l4lppDBXUak2nWyWk\nooyqnhGD4OVQJHudK3hsLRblNknD/zJ6t/wj5kotTHr+JtG8TqZD6oiN3FMICDad\n5K1xh4zz51oElxJZ1IcXRKncjGoxye910VzdIOw39dEPTl3z3JbLClVg6fQpaB9Q\niSvQUeI+VmebtEQNFyVRM+XbsB+QOeN4uU/WQyH8lISI5Rpdzb/Br/YVRYbZLB0=\n=2Hgv\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n"

            "plain": "I?m working on a multicast project. It requieres simulation of data flow over an SDN controller. Unfortunately most controller simulators do not support multicast. \nI followed the instructions on https://pymotw.com/2/socket/multicast.html <https://pymotw.com/2/socket/multicast.html> on how to make OpenDayLight controllers able to manage multicast flux. \nWhile following the procedure over Postman, I found the errors indicated on the bottom.

            "plain": "Hi Dario,\n\nI think the document of openflowplugin has some typos. Obviously, \"<ipv4-\ndestination>200.71.9.5210</ipv4-destination>\" is not a valid IP address.\nAnd from the YANG model [1], the value of this field should be an IP prefix.\n\nI just tested this API with correct IP prefixes on OpenDaylight Carbon SR1.\nIt works. I think the related YANG model never changed since Boron release\nor even earlier. So it should also work on Nitrogen and Oxygen. Not sure\nwhich release you are using.\n\nAdd openflowplugin team and documentation team into this thread.\n\nHi OpenFlow Plugin team,\n\nCan someone take a look at this issue? I think somebody should update the\ndocument to fix this typo at least. Because the same typo also appears in\nthe user guide [2], which is a part of the release.\n\n[1]\nhttps://github.com/opendaylight/openflowplugin/blob/master/model/model-flow-base/src/main/yang/opendaylight-match-types.yang#L108\n[2]\nhttp://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-oxygen/user-guide/openflow-plugin-project-user-guide.html#end-to-end-groups\n\nBest,\nJensen\n\nOn Sun, Apr 8, 2018 at 12:29 AM Dar?o C?sar Luzuriaga Sorribes <\ndarioluzuriaga at gmail.com> wrote:\n\n> Hi, Kai.\n> Thanks for your feedback.\n> I'm getting the same error with \"100.1.1.1/32\" and other\n> variations.I've been following all the steps from\n>\n> https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_OpenFlow_Plugin:End_to_End_Groups\n> .\n> It looks like the previous set ups are okay (in the right directories) as\n> well.\n> ./karaf\n> sudo mn --custom topology.py --topo mytopo\n> --controller=remote,ip=192.168.56.101         xterm h1 h3 h5\n> Is there's something else for me to do?

            "plain": "Hi Daniel and the autorelease team,\n\nI don't really know for sure. The module only contains a few source files\nand takes ~10 seconds to compile/test on my laptop. I remember there were\nquite a few such failures while compiling ALTO modules (and sometimes other\nprojects), but the compilation managed to go through at a certain point. I\ndon't think the transient failures can be mitigated very well by improving\na certain project.\n\nOne hypothesis is that this could be a JVM issue that it runs short of\nresources during the compilation. But according to the log, there should\nstill be plenty of memory. Emm...\n\nSince most failures happen during single feature tests, it would be one\ndirection to look into.\n\nAs for solutions, first I would think of something such as incremental\ncompilation or checkpoints. Maven has this \"-rf\" option to resume a\ncompilation. It may not be a good practice in production systems but I feel\nit might make some sense in handling transient failures.\n\nAnother option might be executing the single feature tests after the\ncompilation. As the projects have their own jenkins jobs, they should be\nless likely to raise compilation errors. Since a success build requires all\nSFT to pass anyway, I think the order may be less critical.\n[Don't know whether this is feasible, though :(]\n\nJust my two cents.\n\nBest,\nKai\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Apr 9, 2018 at 9:50 PM, Daniel Farrell <dfarrell at redhat.com> wrote:\n\n> Hello Kai,\n>\n> Thanks for the diagnosis.\n>\n> Is there anything that can be done to properly mitigate the failure?
