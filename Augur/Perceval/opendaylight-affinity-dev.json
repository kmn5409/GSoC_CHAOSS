            "plain": "Hi affinity developers,\n\nIn case you do not know we have created a new project in OpenDaylight with the goal of coordinating release, integration and test efforts across all projects.\n\nThe project has already gathered a few people willing to collaborate, however as I stated on the last week Hackfest: we have a strong dependency on the other projects, this is we cannot do much without your support.\n\nIn particular we need a contact (at least one) person in your team who can:\n\n1) Sign-up the vHackfest proposed by Ed (see below) so that we are sure we fulfill M3 Continuous Integration Test Start requirement. Note this is IMMEDIATE need (by tomorrow).\n2) Answer general questions about test procedures and quality regarding your project\n3) Provide a high-level overview of your deliverable features (especially those subject to test) so that we can have a consistent release and also better plan for the final tests\n\nI hope I hear from you very soon\n\nThanks in advance\n/Luis\n\n\nFrom: discuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:discuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Ed Warnicke (eaw)\nSent: Sunday, September 15, 2013 6:27 PM\nTo: discuss at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] Integration vHackfest Next Week\n\nI've put up a page for the vHackFest here:\n\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/HackFests:vHackFest_Sept_19_2013\n\nPlease make sure at least one person from each project signs up there\nto participate in the vHackFest on Thursday no later than Mon Sept 16 so we can all meet the M3 Continuous Integration\nTest Start requirement.\n\nEd\nOn Sep 12, 2013, at 7:11 PM, Ed Warnicke (eaw) <eaw at cisco.com<mailto:eaw at cisco.com>> wrote:\n\n\nAccording to the Hydrogen Release Plan:\n\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2013\n\nWe should commence continuous integration testing no later than next week.\n\nIn order to facilitate that its been suggested we do a vHackfest next week to insure that each project:\n\n1)  Has at least some integration testing running\n2)  Has a Jenkins Job that kick off when a project it depends on changes\n\nThe basic thought is to kick off on IRC with Webex's available for screensharing/voice collaboration\nover a 24 hours period (not expecting folks to stay up 24 hours... work your normal hours, but we are a\nglobal team)  My initial thought was kicking off at\n\n10am CEST (Rome, Brataslava) on Thu Sept 19 (aka 1am PST on Thur Sept 19)\nend at\n10am CEST Fri Sept 20 (aka 1am PST on Fri Sept 20)\n\nHow do those times work for folks?  Can I get at least one volunteer from each project?\n\nEd\n\n_______________________________________________\nDiscuss mailing list\nDiscuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:Discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20130916/de97bd80/attachment.html>\n"

We're in the process of creating a new API based on yangtools. A\nsmall sample of the new API can be seen with the path redirect affinity\n(referred to as nfchain in the affinity repository).\n\n 2) Yes, we use the flow programmer service (and use a priority = 3) for\naffinity driven flow rules. Any other southbound protocol using the \"flow\"\ninterface would be compatible in the future.

We're in the process of creating a new API based on yangtools. A small sample of the new API can be seen with the path redirect affinity (referred to as nfchain in the affinity repository).\n\n 2) Yes, we use the flow programmer service (and use a priority = 3) for affinity driven flow rules. Any other southbound protocol using the \"flow\" interface would be compatible in the future. We've only tested with mininet which runs ovswitch.\n\nAre there particular things you are looking to do with affinity. If so we'd be glad to discuss.\n\nCheers,\nSuchi\n\nOn Tue, Nov 5, 2013 at 4:14 AM, Hideyuki Tai <h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com<mailto:h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com>> wrote:\nHi Affinity people,\n\nThere are two questions about Affinity Metadata Service Project.\n\n 1) Where can we get Northbound API information of Affinity Metadata Service?\n 2) What protocol does Affinity Metadata Service use to control\n    network elements?\n    Does it use OpenFlow, and install flow entries to OpenFlow switches?\n\nRegards,\nHideyuki Tai\n\n_______________________________________________\naffinity-dev mailing list\naffinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/affinity-dev\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20131106/64012cbe/attachment-0001.html>\n"

            "plain": "Hi Colin,\n\nI support the idea of having apps and features doing something useful with very few (b) or no configuration (a). Only concern is for those that do not require configuration (a), at least make sure they have very low or none impact in the controller behavior or switches configuration. A good example is Topology Manager that without any configuration reads information from the switches and creates a topology with no impact in controller/switches. On the other side we have Simple Forwarding app that writes flows in the switches whenever the controller discovers a host, I think this is quite an impact for an app that runs out of the box. With this I do not mean to remove this feature or other features like this but move them to (b) -> enable them with simple configuration, what you are actually proposing.\n\nOn the other hand, I take the chance to encourage the projects to come up with a simple (first contact) demo case for their contributions and publish it in the wiki, same thing OVSDB folks have done today at TSC call:\n\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OVSDB_Integration:Mininet_OVSDB_Tutorial\nThanks/Luis\n\n\n\nFrom: vtn-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:vtn-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Colin Dixon\nSent: Wednesday, November 06, 2013 2:45 PM\nTo: <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; <defense4all-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\nSubject: Re: [vtn-dev] Fwd: [affinity-dev] Sample Bundles in the Virtualization Edition\n\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm in the process of removing the requirements to configure SimpleFowarding so that it acts as a normal L2 switch across all the ports in the system when there's no configuration.\n\nI'm probably the primary reason that Ed says it should do *something* when it comes up because I've been hammering like crazy on that point for the base edition.

            "plain": "Hi all,\n\nIt seems to me that affinity.nfchainagent and affinity.implementation bundles depend on affinity.l2agent.\nThe affinity.l2agent runs as a learning switch like the one described in the following link.\n  http://archive.openflow.org/wk/index.php/OpenDayLight_Tutorial#Sample_application:_MAC_Hub_or_Learning_Switch\n\nThe affinity.l2agent installs flow entries when it receives a packet and it knows the destination MAC address of the packet. \nSo the affinity.l2agent allows communication between all hosts it detects.\n\n  L2Agent.java\n    https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=affinity.git;a=blob_plain;f=l2agent/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/affinity/l2agent/L2Agent.java;h=b3b285b415bb30fd732de8f6bbae8a645ca90817;hb=HEAD\n\nIs my understanding right?\n\n\nOn the other hand, VTN Manager allows communication only between hosts which belong to the same virtual tenant.\n\nTherefore, flow entries installed by affinity service and VTN Manager might be inconsistent.\n\nFor the second release, it's better to provide some kind of mechanism to select which approach to use for peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn the last hackfest (September 10), I heard that Madhu planned to add a functionality to Container Manager\nwhich provides a way to select bundles to be copyed for a container to be created.\nI think such an approach solves the problem.\n\nRegards,\nHideyuki Tai\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: vtn-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:vtn-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Hideyuki Tai\n> Sent: Monday, November 18, 2013 4:55 PM\n> To: Anees A Shaikh\n> Cc: <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>; <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org;\n> <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; Ed Warnicke (eaw); vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\n> Subject: Re: [vtn-dev] [opendove-dev] [integration-dev] Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager\n> \n> Hi Anees,\n> \n> > Are any of the virtualization services currently clients of the affinity\n> > service (Open DOVE is not at this point)?\n> \n> VTN Manager is not also a client of the affinity service.\n> And, I don't know any clients of the affinity service in the Virtualization Edition.\n> \n> \n> In my environment, I did not send any configuration to the affinity service,\n> but the affinity service installed flow entries to switches when the controller received packets.\n> \n> I'll check the behavior of the affinity service and VTN Manager in the Virtualization Edition again.\n> \n> Thanks,\n> Hideyuki Tai\n> \n> > -----Original Message-----\n> > From: Anees A Shaikh [mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com]\n> > Sent: Monday, November 18, 2013 9:03 AM\n> > To: Ed Warnicke (eaw)\n> > Cc: <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>; Tai, Hideyuki(??, ??);\n> > integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; opendove-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org;\n> > vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\n> > Subject: Re: [opendove-dev] [integration-dev] Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager\n> >\n> > I don't expect we will be able to get simultaneous coexistence between the\n> > VTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB virtualization implementations in the first release ,\n> > for example.

            "plain": "Suchi, I see several issues brewing here (and I don't think an integration \nis really feasible for Hydrogen).\n\nIf affinity is just doing L2 redirection as an *example* to support such \nan affinity, shouldn't these rules be off by default? \n\nIn other words, if affinity is a companion service for virtual networking, \nmy view is that it should work within the context of the implementations \nproviding the actual virtual network support.  In that case, your first \nsuggested alternative would make the most sense IMO.\n\nIf you want to focus on the L2 service (your second option), then I'm not \nsure what the connection would be to virtual networking since as you said, \nthis would be a single tenant example.\n\nRegarding your questions:  DOVE does only control edge OVS switches, but \nVTN can (and does) program physical OF switches based on what I know about \nit.\n\nAnd yes, both have their own connectivity implementation and would need to \nbe integrated to use a third-party redirection such as the one Affinity is \ntrying to do in this example.  But to be honest, I was expecting affinity \nto primarily provide a relationship database of sorts that other services \ncould use to then implement those relationships on the network.  The \nredirection stuff seems to go way beyond this scope.\n\nthanks.\n\n-- Anees\n\nSuchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com> wrote on 11/18/2013 07:00:45 AM:\n\n> From: Suchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com>\n> To: Hideyuki Tai <h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com>, \n> Cc: Anees A Shaikh/Watson/IBM at IBMUS, \"<affinity-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"<discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>,\n> \"Madhu Venguopal (mavenugo at gmail.com)\" <mavenugo at gmail.com>, \n> \"integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <integration-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \"<opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"\n> <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \"vtn-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\n> Date: 11/18/2013 07:00 AM\n> Subject: Re: [affinity-dev] [vtn-dev] [opendove-dev] [integration-\n> dev] Virtualization Edition Guide for VTN Manager\n> \n> Correction: \n> \n> We don't do mac re-writes.

To summarize\nfor those who didn't attend:\n\nThe traffic redirection service currently implemented by us is for\ndemo/test only and will be maintained as a separate service -- not required\nas a dependency for affinity metadata service. The open question which we\nmay have to punt to next release is exactly how real L2/L3 connectivity\nservices (Dove, VTN) will interact with this metadata.\n\nAlso using the \"container\" as the tenant context seemed to be a reasonable\nassumption for first release. How to map container to virtual network\ncontext is up to the data path implementation.\n\nSuchi\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 18, 2013 at 8:08 PM, Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com> wrote:\n\n> Suchi, I see several issues brewing here (and I don't think an integration\n> is really feasible for Hydrogen).\n>\n> If affinity is just doing L2 redirection as an *example* to support such\n> an affinity, shouldn't these rules be off by default?\n>\n> In other words, if affinity is a companion service for virtual networking,\n> my view is that it should work within the context of the implementations\n> providing the actual virtual network support.

            "plain": "Hi Colin & All,\n\nSorry to jump in mid-dialog but I thought I would share some considerations.\nI like the idea of considering Affinity for programming a controller common policy engine, but I would really want to keep the definition at that level.  In my opinion the policy function should be a component of the controller and be removed from the Affinity definition, I worry that if we align Affinity with Policy it becomes a rules programming interface and we end up exposing the realization rather than the wanted capability.  (Not saying you were heading that way in your thinking, just wanted to bring clarity at least on my opinion.  If my statement was even clear to anyone.)\n\nAlso reflecting on this:\nImagine that you have a set of traffic engineering exception rules which are routing elephant flows, but you also have a set of rules acting as a network tap on a subset of the flows in the network. You don't want to let the reroute avoid the tap. Ideally, you'd somehow make the tap dependent on the reroute rule and thus get updated (synchronously) whenever a reroute happens.\nAn elephant flow is usually like a freeway from one place to the other, you can get on and get off but there are no traffic lights on the way.  What I mean here is that I couldn't imagine trying to tap mid-flow I would usually direct my flow to a service or function that provides that capability.  If I re-route then I should still be aiming the elephant flow at that or an equivalent function in the network.\nIn my experience it is often better to provide simple constraints/assumptions on how we would expect the flows to be constructed/terminated and build from there.  If the base construct get's too complex it propagates the complexity into the policy machinery.\n\nA couple of unsolicited cents from me.  :)\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon <ckd at us.ibm.com<mailto:ckd at us.ibm.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, November 19, 2013 9:10 AM\nTo: David Lenrow <dlenrow at gmail.com<mailto:dlenrow at gmail.com>>\nCc: \"<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] NotSoSimpleForwarding\n\n\nI've spent a lot of time thinking about this and some days I wake up and think that this multi-layered approach makes sense, but I think I've come to believe that it's likely only right for dealing with things at the absolute lowest levels.\n\nLet me start off with a few things I think we can agree would be good:\n1.) We really want policy to affect *all* rules in the network. This includes the \"base\" routes. For instance, if policy says A and B shouldn't be able to talk to each other, the \"base\" routes shouldn't violate that.\n2.)

            "plain": "We may need to start by choosing a model (or choosing to support more than\none \"mode\")\n\nOne approach (e.g. affinity) The default behavior  is traditional (L2\nand/or L3) network. All exceptions live in policy plane.Here the goal is to\nhave best-effort connectivity as the baseline.\n\n   - If I plug into the network I get basic connectivity\n   - If the \"special\" stuff isn't behaving it's easy to roll back to\n   traditional connectivity and forwarding.\n   - Allows expected/default behavior for non-affinitized traffic. Policy\n   only applied to special stuff.\n\nAn alternative approach (e.g. ACI) Everything needs policy to participate.\nIf you don't have a proactive policy pushed, you don't even get on the\nnetwork.\n\n   - More secure against unknown devices getting on the net and\n   probing/denying-service/hacking\n   - Requires potentially large number of rules to describe all traffic,\n   not just \"special\" stuff.\n\n\nI would argue that the former approach allows large networks and numbers of\napps with existing limitations on table sizes, etc. and that the latter\nassumes elements with ability to implement policy enforcement for orders of\nmagnitude more apps/flows.\n\nSingle writer and resolving conflicts suggests that a single policy layer\nshould be the answer. Priorities within this layer allow conflicts to be\nidentified and possibly resolved across the hierarchy of rules.\n\nRegarding: \"Imagine that you have a set of traffic engineering exception\nrules which are routing elephant flows, but you also have a set of rules\nacting as a network tap on a subset of the flows in the network. You don't\nwant to let the reroute avoid the tap. Ideally, you'd somehow make the tap\ndependent on the reroute rule and thus get updated (synchronously) whenever\na reroute happens.\"\n\nIt is possible to insure that when one adds the reroute rule, he is made\naware that this conflicts with the TAP rule. At this point the entity\nediting the policy could:\n1) decide not to reroute\n2) decide to reroute and knowingly break the Tap rule\n3) Create a more complex policy that supports both the reroute and the TAP.\n\nI don't see any way to determine automatically which conflicts are intended\nand which should be denied. I think the best we can do is insure that the\neditor makes changes with full knowledge of the impact on services. If all\nof the policies live in a common, shared repository, it is at least\npossible to insure that conflicts are not\ncreated accidentally, without awareness.\n\nFort NOX has the ability to tell you when a new policy conflicts. It\nassumes that such a conflict is an error. I think we need to detect these\nconflicts, but allow some trusted application to create conflicts\nintentionally.\n\n\nIf we start with a rule that A can't talk to B. And start to add a rule\nsaying that A reaches B using path X, it is clear at the policy layer that\nthese conflict. This is probably an error. If we start with A sends to B on\npath X, and add a rule saying A to B has to go through virtual function F,\nthis is likely an intentional conflict to insert virtual middlebox\n processing. Deciding how to resolve this conflict is beyond the scope of\nthe policy language/DB, but such language should be sufficient to identify\nany/all conflicts and provide context for smart client to differentiate\nbugs from intentional over-ride.\n\nHope these comments are somewhat coherent. I need sleep.\n\n\nDavid Lenrow\n617 329 1861 (Rings all my phones).\n@dlenrow\n\n\nOn Tue, Nov 19, 2013 at 1:45 PM, Christopher Price <\nchristopher.price at ericsson.com> wrote:\n\n>  Hi Colin & All,\n>\n>  Sorry to jump in mid-dialog but I thought I would share some\n> considerations.\n> I like the idea of considering Affinity for programming a controller\n> common policy engine, but I would really want to keep the definition at\n> that level.

Affinity abstraction is a high\nlevel API that specifies the network path requirements (policy,\nconnectivity, ...) for a set of endpoints. Endpoints may correspond to an\napplication or represent some traffic. The affinity implementation will not\nassume openflow on the southbound side.\n\nAs for enforcement -- who enforces what and when -- we will use\nnotifications from affinity manager, so that VTN/Dove may reprogram their\nnetworks when configuration changes.\n\nVTN is openflow-based and offers filtering and redirection services\nnatively within each \"virtual network\" (slice), so the data path for these\naffinities -- path redirect and access control affinities -- for a\nVTN-managed network is a direct translation. Translation with Dove may be\nmore involved. I think programming a mixed network (VTN + dove) has other\nchallenges as well that may need to be resolved centrally, but as you say\nlet's table this for later.\n\nSuchi\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 25, 2013 at 3:02 PM, Benny Rochwerger <BennyR at radware.com>wrote:\n\n> Anees,\n>\n> In that case I remove my disagreement, however from our point of view it\n> is the affinity service that is providing the abstraction and the\n> enforcement, whether affinity touches the network directly or thru a\n> network virtualization layer  should  transparent  applications the network\n> abstraction API (I.e. affinity in our case)\n>\n> Benny\n>\n> Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com> wrote:\n>\n>\n> Benny, your last sentence is what I am getting at -- so I don't think\n> there is any disagreement.

I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\nFrom: Suchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com<mailto:suchi.raman at plexxi.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, December 3, 2013 6:31 AM\nTo: Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com<mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com>>\nCc: \"<discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, Madhu Venguopal <vmadhu at redhat.com<mailto:vmadhu at redhat.com>>, \"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] [affinity-dev] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n\nIn addition to the basic metadata setting/getting, the affinity engine has a way to set forwarding rules for traffic redirection.

            "plain": "So from what I understand from this and other previous conversations, it looks like there are 2 trends for the Virtualization edition:\n\n1) Run all apps together but try to use only one virtualization at a time, for this we need:\n\n- Virtualization apps do not take any action in the network (i.e. like writing flows) by default but after activating something through their NB API\n- Virtualization apps do not share NB APIs, this includes the Neutron and so that Madhu proposal makes sense here\n\n2) Enable (by configuration) one app at a time. In this case the above is not necessary for obvious reasons, however this looks more like a 3-4 Virtualization editions instead of only 1.\n\nAnyway whatever is the implementation the result looks the same: For Hydrogen release we cannot use more than one Virtualization at a time, am I right?\n\nBR/Luis\n\n\n\nFrom: affinity-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:affinity-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Christopher Price\nSent: Tuesday, December 03, 2013 7:12 AM\nTo: Suchi Raman; Anees A Shaikh\nCc: <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; Madhu Venguopal; vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [affinity-dev] [OpenDaylight Discuss] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n\nHi Suchi,\n\nGood questions.\nI will not pretend to be an expert in this area as I have had little time to dig into these projects unfortunately.\n\nMy reaction/response is therefore one of practicality.\n\nWe are so close to the delivery date it feel unreasonable to integrate these functions for the Hydrogen release.\nI suggest we aim at delivering option (a) in the 2014 release.  I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\nFrom: Suchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com<mailto:suchi.raman at plexxi.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, December 3, 2013 6:31 AM\nTo: Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com<mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com>>\nCc: \"<discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, Madhu Venguopal <vmadhu at redhat.com<mailto:vmadhu at redhat.com>>, \"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] [affinity-dev] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n\nIn addition to the basic metadata setting/getting, the affinity engine has a way to set forwarding rules for traffic redirection. This is the feature required for Radware.\n\nWe have a couple of options --\n\n(a) Include affinity in the base edition for Hydrogen release, targeted for small scale testing and campus networks. Design integration between Dove/VTN/affinity and deliver for next release.\n\nor\n\n(b) Limit affinity to basic metadata setting/getting and leave it in the virtualization edition. Postpone Radware integration to next release. Design VTN/Dove affinity integration in next release.\n\nOption (b) is easier and option (a) puts us in better position for next release. This is relatively minor in comparison to the Dove + VTN discussion which is also in this thread.\n\nComments welcome.\n\n\nOn Tue, Dec 3, 2013 at 2:43 AM, Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com<mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com>> wrote:\nAs we've discussed at some length, Affinity is not in the same category of\nfunction as the virtualization implementations, and also doesn't implement\nthe Neutron APIs, so I don't think the issue of multiple Neutron API\nclients applies to Affinity.\n\n Per Tai-san's note, we're addressing the issue of overlapping control of\nthe network by i) making the Affinity example flows default-off and\noptional, and ii) providing configuration support so that the\nvirtualization edition runs a single implementation (i.e., one of\nVTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB).

In this case the above is not necessary for obvious reasons, however this looks more like a 3-4 Virtualization editions instead of only 1.\n\nAnyway whatever is the implementation the result looks the same: For Hydrogen release we cannot use more than one Virtualization at a time, am I right?\n\nBR/Luis\n\n\n\nFrom: affinity-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:affinity-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Christopher Price\nSent: Tuesday, December 03, 2013 7:12 AM\nTo: Suchi Raman; Anees A Shaikh\nCc: <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; Madhu Venguopal; vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [affinity-dev] [OpenDaylight Discuss] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n\nHi Suchi,\n\nGood questions.\nI will not pretend to be an expert in this area as I have had little time to dig into these projects unfortunately.\n\nMy reaction/response is therefore one of practicality.\n\nWe are so close to the delivery date it feel unreasonable to integrate these functions for the Hydrogen release.\nI suggest we aim at delivering option (a) in the 2014 release.  I would also support the Affinity API being exposed in the basic release in 2014 as I see value in a higher level API even in the base release, this would be very useful and interesting to expose to campus and lab environments enabling higher layer app development.\n\nRegards,\nChris\n\nFrom: Suchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com<mailto:suchi.raman at plexxi.com>>\nDate: Tuesday, December 3, 2013 6:31 AM\nTo: Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com<mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com>>\nCc: \"<discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, Madhu Venguopal <vmadhu at redhat.com<mailto:vmadhu at redhat.com>>, \"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\nSubject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] [affinity-dev] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n\nIn addition to the basic metadata setting/getting, the affinity engine has a way to set forwarding rules for traffic redirection. This is the feature required for Radware.\n\nWe have a couple of options --\n\n(a) Include affinity in the base edition for Hydrogen release, targeted for small scale testing and campus networks. Design integration between Dove/VTN/affinity and deliver for next release.\n\nor\n\n(b) Limit affinity to basic metadata setting/getting and leave it in the virtualization edition. Postpone Radware integration to next release. Design VTN/Dove affinity integration in next release.\n\nOption (b) is easier and option (a) puts us in better position for next release. This is relatively minor in comparison to the Dove + VTN discussion which is also in this thread.\n\nComments welcome.\n\n\nOn Tue, Dec 3, 2013 at 2:43 AM, Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com<mailto:aashaikh at us.ibm.com>> wrote:\nAs we've discussed at some length, Affinity is not in the same category of\nfunction as the virtualization implementations, and also doesn't implement\nthe Neutron APIs, so I don't think the issue of multiple Neutron API\nclients applies to Affinity.\n\n Per Tai-san's note, we're addressing the issue of overlapping control of\nthe network by i) making the Affinity example flows default-off and\noptional, and ii) providing configuration support so that the\nvirtualization edition runs a single implementation (i.e., one of\nVTN/OpenDOVE/OVSDB).   (unless something else was discussed in the TWS\ncall earlier today)\n\nthanks.\n\n-- Anees\n\ndiscuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> wrote on 12/02/2013 07:55:37 PM:\n\n> From: Hideyuki Tai <h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com<mailto:h-tai at cd.jp.nec.com>>\n> To: \"Ed Warnicke (eaw)\" <eaw at cisco.com<mailto:eaw at cisco.com>>,\n> Cc: \"<discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>\"\n> <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"\n> <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"<affinity-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>,\n> \"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <opendove-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, Madhu Venguopal <vmadhu at redhat.com<mailto:vmadhu at redhat.com>>,\n> \"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>\n> Date: 12/02/2013 07:56 PM\n> Subject: Re: [OpenDaylight Discuss] [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL -\n> Neutron API enhancement to include the southbound driver info\n> Sent by: discuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>\n>\n> Hi Ed,\n>\n> Madhu's proposal focus on the co-existing problem between southbound\n> drivers for Neutron Interface.\n> I explained about this problem in the following mail.\n>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/discuss/2013-November/000910.html\n> To solve this problem, I think Madhu's proposal is good.\n>\n> The co-existing problem between Affinity, VTN Manager, and\n> simpleforwarding is a different problem.\n> In the Virtualization Edition, more than one application exist, and\n> they try to control the same network resources simultaneously.\n> Because different applications have different policies on how to\n> control network resources, it's obvious that flow entries installed\n> by different applications are inconsistent.\n> To solve this problem, we need other solution.\n>\n> Regards,\n> Hideyuki Tai\n>\n> From: Ed Warnicke (eaw) [mailto:eaw at cisco.com<mailto:eaw at cisco.com>]\n> Sent: Tuesday, December 03, 2013 11:44 AM\n> To: Tai, Hideyuki\n> Cc: Madhu Venguopal; opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; vtn-\n> dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; Kyle\n> Mestery (kmestery); <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>;\n> <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>>\n> Subject: Re: [ovsdb-dev] [vtn-dev] ODL - Neutron API enhancement to\n> include the southbound driver info\n>\n> So I see the value of this...

This is EXTREMELY important for the release.\n\nAs discussed during the TSC and the feverish work being done to get to \nthe Release Readiness, we are tracking all the activities using :\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoSzir1BfjyWdDQyVElWNG9mcWxhblREckZjbjFxUVE#gid=1\n\nThis email is to take care of following 2 high priority items under \n\"Global Code Cleanup\" :\n- \" Identify all places dependency versions in project pom.xml files are \nnot current for all ODL Dependencies\"\n- \" Update dependency versions in all pom.xml files to current SNAPSHOT \nversion for all ODL Dependencies\"\n\nWe have a jenkins job that is running on the controller project : \n*https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-version-changes/configure*\nThe \"versions\" plugin in this job will take care most of the work. It \nwill find the LATEST dependency and also automatically submit a gerrit \nchanges.\nHow cool is that !!! ? : (*Example Gerrit submission : \nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/4149/*)\n\nBased on our investigation, we have a simple Action Item for each of the \nproject owners in each project :\n\n*All you have to do as a project owner is to copy the above jenkins \nconfiguration into your own project and do the necessary modifications \nbased**\n**on your project build needs. The most important maven option of \ninterest :   (-B versions:use-latest-versions -DallowSnapshots=true).**\n**Also observe the execute shell commands which you would need for auto \ngerrit review.*\n\nThe goal is to bring down the dependency errors \n(*https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console*) \nto zero\nand let the integration project build to succeed.\n\nThanks,\nMadhu\n\n\nFor the curious ones - more details :\n\nI pushed the Dependency-Convergence enforcer changes to integration \nbranch earlier today :http://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/4189\nand this identifies all the dependencies that are not converged. We also \nhave a jenkins job enabled in the integration project that will\nrun daily once to keep track of these failures :\nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/\n\nFailures seen in the first run :\nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/integration/job/integration-dependencyConvergence/1/console\n\nPlease look for \"Dependency convergence error\" text in the above console \nlog and this will give the hint on what are the failures that are \ncurrently active\nin each of the bundle. The goal is to bring this to 0 failures.\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20140113/dc5925dc/attachment.html>\n"

Finish up the \"Release Readiness : Dependency convergence\" ASAP.\n(https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:DependencyConvergence)\n\n1. Please review this email from Giovanni Meo : \nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-August/001042.html\n     Most of it holds even for today. Some info are outdated (but still \nquite useful to know).\n\n2. Prepare your project for the release (refer to \nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/978/).\n     1a. Every POM file should have proper <scm> section. Care must be \ntaken to make sure every pom file in a project must carry the exact \n<scm> section.\n     1b. Add maven-release-plugin to the plugin management section of \nyour project (refer to opendaylight/commons/opendaylight/pom.xml in the \nabove gerrit : 978).\n     1c. If not already present, add a POM file to the root of your \nproject from where we can execute the release operations.\n\n3. We will be using maven-release-plugin. Hence please review : \nhttp://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html\n\n4. Thank god, we have Giovanni amongst us :-), he already went through \nthe painful process of releasing artifacts from the controller project and\n      the jenkins jobs used for that (in September'2013) are as follows :\n      4a. Prepare-only : \nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release-prepare-only/configure.\n      4b. Final Publish : \nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release/\n      Please review these & ask any questions you might have. Dont copy \nit yet to your projects.\n\n5. Based on the Dependency tree evaluation, the only incorrect project \ndependencies was identified on controller depending directly on bgpcep.\n     We have to remove this dependency from the controller project.\n\n6. It is recommended to start with the 1.0.0 as the release/branch \nversion. If we agree on 1.0.0 as the release/branch name, then the \nversion of the\n     parent root pom must be set to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which will be \nautomatically used by the jenkins job.\n\n\n*List of things ToDo on 01/27**& 01/28*\n\n0. Though the following activities are per-project related, it is \nrecommended to do this as a group with representatives from all the \nprojects present.\n\n1. Based on the dependency tree evaluation, we have to perform the \nrelease process in the following sequence\n     - yangtools\n     - controller\n     - openflowjava , ovsdb, opendove, vtn, affinity, bgpcep, \nlispflowmapping, snmp4sdn, defense4all (all these projects can be done \nin parallel)\n     - openflowplugin (after openflowjava).\n\n2. Any inter-project SNAPSHOT version dependencies must be changed to \nthe RELEASE version dependency. For example, Controller project is\n     dependent on Yangtools SNAPSHOT, it must be changed to the \nyangtools's release version & so on and so forth and commit the changes \nto your repo.\n\n3. In each project, we have to copy both the Prepare-only & \nFinal-Publish jenkins jobs from the controller project & adjust it to \nper-project configurations.\n\n4. Execute the prepare-only jenkins job and make sure all the issues are \nresolved and we get to a successful execution.\n\n5. Execute the Final-publish job (bulk-release) on your project that \nwill publish the artifact to the nexus repo.\n\n6. In Step4, the maven-release-plugin would also drop a tag in the GIT \nrepo to mark the exact release point. We can either manually create a \nbranch on\n     each of the project with a Branch version (please note that this \nBranch version is Nothing to do with the artifact versions, as they are \ndifferent in each bundle)\n     or automate the branch creation on the jenkins job.\n\nOfcourse, there are tons of detailed information available on all these. \nPlease dont take this lightly. Tons of stuffs to do in getting\nthe release out & hence your attention to this is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n-Madhu\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20140114/b652233a/attachment.html>\n"

            "plain": "Hi Muthu,\n\nI forgot to mention in the email that, this recommendation is purely for \nthe Hydrogen release & we will deal with the\ndetails on branch management and versioning post-hydrogen release. There \nis a huge implication on having multiple\nversions of bundle floating around and we need much more stricter \nrecommendations on how to handle such scenarios.\nBut, since for the Hydrogen release, we are converging on a release \nbundle, this issue can be postponed for Post-Hydrogen.\n\nTo answer your question :\n1. Yes. the maven-release-plugin will automatically bump up the SNAPSHOT \nversion from\n<major>.<minor>.<micro>-SNAPSHOT  to <major>.<minor>.<micro+1>-SNAPSHOT.\n\n2. Regarding the version changes post-hydrogen and dependencies, I would \nlike to defer the discussion on a different email thread\n     and not mix with the Release Readiness & i hope you are okay with that.\n\nThere is certainly a bigger implication on the bundle versions, \nSNAPSHOT, STABLE releases and their dependency trees.\nA lot of discussion have to go inside that to have a stabler subsequent \nHelium release.\n\nThanks,\n-Madhu\n\nOn 1/14/14, 3:06 AM, Muthukumaran Kothandaraman wrote:\n> Hi Madhu,\n>\n> A couple of quick clarification on future changes\n>\n> - Soon after the RELEASE version, we would also have the subsequent \n> SNAPSHOT version - I understand that release-plugin provides that \n> discipline - but would we be following the same or there are any \n> changes in ODL process-policy ?\n>\n> - Would we be avoiding version changes in SNAPSHOT phase in future - \n> the implication in mail-chain here - \n> https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-December/002312.html\n>   Again, unmistakably, Giovanni provided a mechanism to streamline \n> this :-)\n>\n>   But, would we have a policy that during SNAPSHOT phase we do not \n> change module versions in future ?\n>   Because version-changes during SNAPSHOT phase could help binary \n> dependency flexibility (eg. not all modules could pickup latest \n> versions of their dependencies) but from source-control perspective \n> version-changes do not help.\n>\n> Regards\n>\n> Muthukumaran (Muthu)\n> L  : 080-49141730\n>\n> P(existence at t) = 1- 1/P(existence at t-1)\n>\n>\n>\n> From: Madhu Venguopal <mavenugo at gmail.com>\n> To: dev <controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> yangtools-dev at lists.opendaylight.org, \n> \"openflowjava-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <openflowjava-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"       \n>  <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"<defense4all-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"   \n>  <defense4all-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"bgpcep-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <bgpcep-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> \"lispflowmapping-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <lispflowmapping-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n> snmp4sdn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org, \"Ed Warnicke (eaw)\" \n> <eaw at cisco.com>, ttkacik at cisco.com, abhijitk <abhijitk at us.ibm.com>, \n> \"michal.polkorab\" <michal.polkorab at pantheon.sk>, Anees A Shaikh \n> <aashaikh at us.ibm.com>, Ryan Moats <rmoats at us.ibm.com>, Suchi Raman \n> <suchi.raman at plexxi.com>, gerag <gerag at radware.com>, konstantinp \n> <KonstantinP at radware.com>, rovarga <rovarga at cisco.com>, \n> \"david.goldberg\" <david.goldberg at contextream.com>, ylhsieh \n> <ylhsieh at itri.org.tw>, \"integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n> <integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, Luis Gomez \n> <luis.gomez at ericsson.com>, Colin Dixon <ckd at us.ibm.com>, David Meyer \n> <dmm at 1-4-5.net>, Chris Wright <chrisw at redhat.com>, Giovanni Meo \n> <gmeo at cisco.com>\n> Date: 01/14/2014 04:01 PM\n> Subject: [controller-dev] Release Readiness : From SNAPSHOT to Release \n> &  Branching recommendations\n> Sent by: controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org\n> ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n>\n>\n>\n> Hi Devs,\n>\n> Apologies on the long email again.

Finish up the \"Release Readiness : Dependency convergence\" ASAP.\n>     \n> (_https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:DependencyConvergence_)\n>\n> 1. Please review this email from Giovanni Meo : \n> _https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-August/001042.html_\n>     Most of it holds even for today. Some info are outdated (but still \n> quite useful to know).\n>\n> 2. Prepare your project for the release (refer to \n> _https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/978/_).\n>     1a. Every POM file should have proper <scm> section. Care must be \n> taken to make sure every pom file in a project must carry the exact \n> <scm> section.\n>     1b. Add maven-release-plugin to the plugin management section of \n> your project (refer to opendaylight/commons/opendaylight/pom.xml in \n> the above gerrit : 978).\n>     1c. If not already present, add a POM file to the root of your \n> project from where we can execute the release operations.\n>\n> 3. We will be using maven-release-plugin. Hence please review : \n> _http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html_\n>\n> 4. Thank god, we have Giovanni amongst us :-), he already went through \n> the painful process of releasing artifacts from the controller project \n> and\n>      the jenkins jobs used for that (in September'2013) are as follows :\n>      4a. Prepare-only : \n> _https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release-prepare-only/configure_.\n>      4b. Final Publish : \n> _https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release/_\n>      Please review these & ask any questions you might have. Dont copy \n> it yet to your projects.\n>\n> 5. Based on the Dependency tree evaluation, the only incorrect project \n> dependencies was identified on controller depending directly on bgpcep.\n>     We have to remove this dependency from the controller project.\n>\n> 6. It is recommended to start with the 1.0.0 as the release/branch \n> version. If we agree on 1.0.0 as the release/branch name, then the \n> version of the\n>     parent root pom must be set to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which will be \n> automatically used by the jenkins job.\n>\n> *\n> List of things ToDo on 01/27 & 01/28*\n>\n> 0. Though the following activities are per-project related, it is \n> recommended to do this as a group with representatives from all the \n> projects present.\n>\n> 1. Based on the dependency tree evaluation, we have to perform the \n> release process in the following sequence\n>     - yangtools\n>     - controller\n>     - openflowjava , ovsdb, opendove, vtn, affinity, bgpcep, \n> lispflowmapping, snmp4sdn, defense4all (all these projects can be done \n> in parallel)\n>     - openflowplugin (after openflowjava).\n>\n> 2. Any inter-project SNAPSHOT version dependencies must be changed to \n> the RELEASE version dependency. For example, Controller project is\n>     dependent on Yangtools SNAPSHOT, it must be changed to the \n> yangtools's release version & so on and so forth and commit the \n> changes to your repo.\n>\n> 3. In each project, we have to copy both the Prepare-only & \n> Final-Publish jenkins jobs from the controller project & adjust it to \n> per-project configurations.\n>\n> 4. Execute the prepare-only jenkins job and make sure all the issues \n> are resolved and we get to a successful execution.\n>\n> 5. Execute the Final-publish job (bulk-release) on your project that \n> will publish the artifact to the nexus repo.\n>\n> 6. In Step4, the maven-release-plugin would also drop a tag in the GIT \n> repo to mark the exact release point. We can either manually create a \n> branch on\n>     each of the project with a Branch version (please note that this \n> Branch version is Nothing to do with the artifact versions, as they \n> are different in each bundle)\n>     or automate the branch creation on the jenkins job.\n>\n> Ofcourse, there are tons of detailed information available on all \n> these. Please dont take this lightly. Tons of stuffs to do in getting\n> the release out & hence your attention to this is highly appreciated.\n>\n> Thanks,\n> -Madhu_______________________________________________\n> controller-dev mailing list\n> controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\n> https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/controller-dev\n>\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20140114/3f162808/attachment-0001.html>\n"

        "body": {
            "plain": "Hi Suchi:\n\nThe attached file contains a list of filenames within your git repo that\nhave been identified as *not* having a License/Copyright header.\n\nThat is not to say that you *should* put a copyright/license header on each\nof these files.  Some of the files are for third-party components.  *Clearly,\nyou should not change or insert your copyright statement on a file that you\nor your organization did not author*.\n\nI*n general, you should provide a copyright/license header in all files\nwithin your repository for which you, or your organization are the author*.\n If you look at it from the user's point of view, due to the copyright\nlaws, the user is unable to copy or distribute any copyrightable work\nwithout express written permission by the author.  If you do not provide a\ncopyright/license header, then the user has no rights to take your file\nfrom the repository and work with it.  They instead would have to *assume*\nthat, since the project is identified as licensed under the EPL1.0 and/or\nother files within the directory structure are licensed under the EPL1.0,\nthen this file is *probably* licensed under the EPL1.0 as well.  Making the\nuser assume that they are probably OK to use a file should be avoided if\npossible.\n\nAlso, as you recall, we all sign off on the Developer Certificate of\n Origin (DCO) each time we commit anything to the repository.  The DCO\nrelies on there being a license declaration within each file and refers to\nit stating:\n\n        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n            have the right to submit it under the open source license\n            indicated in the file; or...\n\nSo, in order for the above clause to be true in the DCO, the license header\nneeds to be present in each file.\n\nFinally, there are some files that are not copyrightable, and what is, and\nis not copyrightable depends on a myriad of factors including jurisdiction,\nfile contents, etc..  Instead of trying to decide if a file is\ncopyrightable or not, we suggest that you include a copyright/license\nheader on all files that you own and which you want a user to be able to\nwork with when they take it from the repository.  If a file turns out to\nnot be copyrightable by the law, you have still provided valuable\ninformation regarding your intent for your downstream users.\n\nThanks for your help with this.  If you have any questions, please post\nthem to the Discuss list.  We'll get them answered there so that everyone\ncan learn from it.\n\nPhil.\n-- \nPhil Robb\nDirector - Networking Solutions\nThe Linux Foundation\n(O) 970-229-5949\n(M) 970-420-4292\nSkype:

There \nis a huge implication on having multiple\nversions of bundle floating around and we need much more stricter \nrecommendations on how to handle such scenarios.\nBut, since for the Hydrogen release, we are converging on a release \nbundle, this issue can be postponed for Post-Hydrogen.\n\nTo answer your question :\n1. Yes. the maven-release-plugin will automatically bump up the SNAPSHOT \nversion from \n<major>.<minor>.<micro>-SNAPSHOT  to <major>.<minor>.<micro+1>-SNAPSHOT.\n\n2. Regarding the version changes post-hydrogen and dependencies, I would \nlike to defer the discussion on a different email thread\n    and not mix with the Release Readiness & i hope you are okay with \nthat.\n\nThere is certainly a bigger implication on the bundle versions, SNAPSHOT, \nSTABLE releases and their dependency trees.\nA lot of discussion have to go inside that to have a stabler subsequent \nHelium release.\n\nThanks,\n-Madhu\n\nOn 1/14/14, 3:06 AM, Muthukumaran Kothandaraman wrote:\nHi Madhu, \n\nA couple of quick clarification on future changes \n\n- Soon after the RELEASE version, we would also have the subsequent \nSNAPSHOT version - I understand that release-plugin provides that \ndiscipline - but would we be following the same or there are any changes \nin ODL process-policy ? \n\n- Would we be avoiding version changes in SNAPSHOT phase in future - the \nimplication in mail-chain here - \nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-December/002312.html \n\n  Again, unmistakably, Giovanni provided a mechanism to streamline this \n:-)   \n\n  But, would we have a policy that during SNAPSHOT phase we do not change \nmodule versions in future ? \n  Because version-changes during SNAPSHOT phase could help binary \ndependency flexibility (eg. not all modules could pickup latest versions \nof their dependencies) but from source-control perspective version-changes \ndo not help. \n\nRegards\n\nMuthukumaran (Muthu)\nL  : 080-49141730\n\nP(existence at t) = 1- 1/P(existence at t-1) \n\n\n\nFrom:        Madhu Venguopal <mavenugo at gmail.com> \nTo:        dev <controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \nyangtools-dev at lists.opendaylight.org, \n\"openflowjava-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n<openflowjava-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n<openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <vtn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n<opendove-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \"\n<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"        \n<affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \"\n<defense4all-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\"        \n<defense4all-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"bgpcep-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" <bgpcep-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \n\"lispflowmapping-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n<lispflowmapping-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, \nsnmp4sdn-dev at lists.opendaylight.org, \"Ed Warnicke (eaw)\" <eaw at cisco.com>, \nttkacik at cisco.com, abhijitk <abhijitk at us.ibm.com>, \"michal.polkorab\" \n<michal.polkorab at pantheon.sk>, Anees A Shaikh <aashaikh at us.ibm.com>, Ryan \nMoats <rmoats at us.ibm.com>, Suchi Raman <suchi.raman at plexxi.com>, gerag \n<gerag at radware.com>, konstantinp <KonstantinP at radware.com>, rovarga \n<rovarga at cisco.com>, \"david.goldberg\" <david.goldberg at contextream.com>, \nylhsieh <ylhsieh at itri.org.tw>, \"integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\" \n<integration-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, Luis Gomez \n<luis.gomez at ericsson.com>, Colin Dixon <ckd at us.ibm.com>, David Meyer \n<dmm at 1-4-5.net>, Chris Wright <chrisw at redhat.com>, Giovanni Meo \n<gmeo at cisco.com> \nDate:        01/14/2014 04:01 PM \nSubject:        [controller-dev] Release Readiness : From SNAPSHOT to \nRelease &        Branching recommendations \nSent by:        controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org \n\n\n\nHi Devs,\n\nApologies on the long email again. I cant think of any better way to \ncommunicate this kind of info. \nThis email is also updated in wiki \nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:ReleaseRecommendations\n.\n\nThe last step of the development process for the Hydrogen (or any \nsubsequent release) is to move from SNAPSHOT\nversions of the bundle to the release version. This release version of the \nbundles are deemed the stable version.\n\nAs per the collective decision during the TSC call, we decided on starting \nthe process of cutting over from SNAPSHOT\nto the release version on 01/27 & we expect this process to be complete by \n01/28.\n\nIf this is the last step and if it is planned on 01/27, why are we \ndiscussing about this now ?.\nThe answer is simple, There are lots of pre-work to be done here and the \nproject owners (& volunteers) should gear up well in advance.\n\nThis email will provide the recommendation for cutting-over to the release \nversions and the subsequent branching strategy.\nThis is a heavy topic and we have a ton of information to share and \ndiscuss.\n\nShort list of Things TODO for Project Owners and Project Volunteers to \nstart working on today (01/14/2014)\n\n0. Finish up the \"Release Readiness : Dependency convergence\" ASAP.\n    (\nhttps://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Simultaneous_Release_Plan_2014:DependencyConvergence\n)\n\n1. Please review this email from Giovanni Meo : \nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/controller-dev/2013-August/001042.html\n\n    Most of it holds even for today. Some info are outdated (but still \nquite useful to know).\n\n2. Prepare your project for the release (refer to \nhttps://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/978/).\n    1a. Every POM file should have proper <scm> section. Care must be \ntaken to make sure every pom file in a project must carry the exact <scm> \nsection.\n    1b. Add maven-release-plugin to the plugin management section of your \nproject (refer to opendaylight/commons/opendaylight/pom.xml in the above \ngerrit : 978).\n    1c. If not already present, add a POM file to the root of your project \nfrom where we can execute the release operations.\n\n3. We will be using maven-release-plugin. Hence please review : \nhttp://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/index.html\n\n4. Thank god, we have Giovanni amongst us :-), he already went through the \npainful process of releasing artifacts from the controller project and \n     the jenkins jobs used for that (in September'2013) are as follows :\n     4a. Prepare-only : \nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release-prepare-only/configure\n.\n     4b. Final Publish : \nhttps://jenkins.opendaylight.org/controller/job/controller-bulk-release/\n     Please review these & ask any questions you might have. Dont copy it \nyet to your projects.\n\n5. Based on the Dependency tree evaluation, the only incorrect project \ndependencies was identified on controller depending directly on bgpcep.\n    We have to remove this dependency from the controller project.\n\n6. It is recommended to start with the 1.0.0 as the release/branch \nversion. If we agree on 1.0.0 as the release/branch name, then the version \nof the \n    parent root pom must be set to 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which will be \nautomatically used by the jenkins job.\n\n\nList of things ToDo on 01/27 & 01/28\n\n0. Though the following activities are per-project related, it is \nrecommended to do this as a group with representatives from all the \nprojects present.\n\n1. Based on the dependency tree evaluation, we have to perform the release \nprocess in the following sequence \n    - yangtools\n    - controller\n    - openflowjava , ovsdb, opendove, vtn, affinity, bgpcep, \nlispflowmapping, snmp4sdn, defense4all (all these projects can be done in \nparallel)\n    - openflowplugin (after openflowjava).\n\n2. Any inter-project SNAPSHOT version dependencies must be changed to the \nRELEASE version dependency. For example, Controller project is\n    dependent on Yangtools SNAPSHOT, it must be changed to the yangtools's \nrelease version & so on and so forth and commit the changes to your repo.\n\n3. In each project, we have to copy both the Prepare-only & Final-Publish \njenkins jobs from the controller project & adjust it to per-project \nconfigurations.\n\n4. Execute the prepare-only jenkins job and make sure all the issues are \nresolved and we get to a successful execution.\n\n5. Execute the Final-publish job (bulk-release) on your project that will \npublish the artifact to the nexus repo.\n\n6. In Step4, the maven-release-plugin would also drop a tag in the GIT \nrepo to mark the exact release point. We can either manually create a \nbranch on\n    each of the project with a Branch version (please note that this \nBranch version is Nothing to do with the artifact versions, as they are \ndifferent in each bundle)\n    or automate the branch creation on the jenkins job.\n\nOfcourse, there are tons of detailed information available on all these. \nPlease dont take this lightly. Tons of stuffs to do in getting\nthe release out & hence your attention to this is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n-Madhu_______________________________________________\ncontroller-dev mailing list\ncontroller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/controller-dev\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20140115/1c7209d8/attachment-0001.html>\n"

I downloaded the source code of affinity project through git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/affinity, so I guess I may not have a copy of that. Can you explain more about integration tree for me? Please tell me where to download the integration tree and also how to build it, and I will really appreciate that!\n\nIn addition, where did you upload your changes? Are there also a website that I can get the \"release\" version of affinity, instead of downloading it from git?\n\nFinally, the python scripts I used was packaged in the source codes I downloaded from git clone, so I don't know whether my scripts version is deprecated or not. But I do figured out one strange thing about script files. I found a function in affinity_control.py, which named \"enable_waypoint\". This function tries to call the affinity northbound that sends a http PUT request in the form of \"link/{link_name}/enable\". However, I didn't find any northbound API in affinity northbound which included a command substring called \"enable\", so I am wondering if my affinity project version and scripts verison just didn't match.\n\nThx for reply!\n\nBest Regards,\nYu-Chieh\n________________________________________\n???: Suchi Raman [suchi.raman at plexxi.com]\n????: 2014?02?08? ?? 03:47\n???: ???\n??: <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\n??: Re: [affinity-dev] Problems when running demo.py\n\nI pushed a change about 24 hours ago (which is not in Hydrogen) which will make it easier to run this demo.\n\nHowever, the best way to pick up this change is to rebuild the integration tree.

            "plain": "Hi all:\n\nI am using the virtualization edition of Opendaylight, and I got few questions about the affinity project.\n\n1. I see the configuration written in the file \"run.sh\" excludes several bundles while executing affinity bundles (vtn, opendove, ovsdb, controller.samples). However, when the config is set to \"ovsdb\" or \"opendove\", they did not exclude affinity bundles. Also, I saw one line on the wiki: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Affinity_Metadata_Service:Release_Review#Installation\nUnder the title \"Architectural Issues\" it writes: \"Implementation of specific affinities on non-openflow networks (OVSDB, VTN, opendove).\", which I think the affinity project is going to integrate with the 3 mentioned bundles. So, why is it necessary to exclude those bundles when executing affinity project? Why is it not necessary to exclude affinity bundles while executing other configuration? \n\n2. Is affinity project capable under different configuration such as \"ovsdb\" or \"opendove\"? I have tried to run demo.py under the setup of \"ovsdb\", and it failed just as I expected. Also, I didn't see it exclude the bundles under \"controller.samples\", so I expect the affinity project won't work under the other configuration. But why don't those configurations just exclude the affinity bundles?\n\n3. Why is it necessary to exclude the bundles under \"controller.samples\"? Is there no way to make them exist at the same time?\n\nThx for reply!\n\nBest Regards,\nYu-Chieh\n\n====================================================================\n???????????????????????????????????????????? \nThis email may contain confidential information.

And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.\n\nNow Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:\nThose apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch.

And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.\n\nWith applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.\n\n\n\nThere are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichal\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________ L2switch-dev mailing list L2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<UrlBlockedError.aspx> https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/l2switch-dev\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20150112/b5e326e3/attachment-0001.html>\n"

I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.\nI could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.\nI could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.\nBasically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.\nSo, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.\n\nIt may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.\nAlso, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.\n\nJust my thoughts.\nCorrect me if I am wrong in any of the above.\n\nThanks,\nAneesha\n\nFrom: controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org [mailto:controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org] On Behalf Of Raghurama Bhat\nSent: Monday, January 12, 2015 3:46 PM\nTo: Colin Dixon; Abhijit Kumbhare\nCc: openflowplugin-dev; groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; release at lists.opendaylight.org; affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org; Ed Warnicke (eaw); l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org\nSubject: Re: [controller-dev] [openflowplugin-dev] [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo\n\nI agree that L2 switch is not a logical home for  generic network services as long as the project is called L2 Switch.  But,the name aside, That was exactly the proposed charter of the project.\n\n\"This proposal is to separate out the Layer 2 specific handling code into a separate project and also create several reusable services. Following are some of the generic services we intend to create.?\n\n At the end of the day it does not matter too much where the code belongs. With the right Karaf feature names and dependencies user will be able to find it.  It is just that, One would not think to look at Open Flow Plugin for generic network services.  For some of these services, I can understand the model being the only thing common/generic and each southbound plugin potentially supplying its own implementation. Still, I think there would be some services which are common, protocol independent network services and we need a good home for those.\n\nThanks,\n\n?Raghu\n\nFrom: Colin Dixon <colin at colindixon.com<mailto:colin at colindixon.com>>\nDate: Monday, January 12, 2015 at 2:13 PM\nTo: Abhijit Kumbhare <abhijitkoss at gmail.com<mailto:abhijitkoss at gmail.com>>\nCc: openflowplugin-dev <openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"release at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <release at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\" <controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>>, \"Ed Warnicke (eaw)\" <eaw at cisco.com<mailto:eaw at cisco.com>>\nSubject: Re: [controller-dev] [openflowplugin-dev] [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo\n\n+1 to what Abhijit says above, but I'll add the caveat that if it ends up in the OF-plugin, it should be housed in such a way that it tries as best it can to avoid being any more OpenFlow-specific than it already is. Also, it should be amenable to other plugins providing the backing functionality.\nFor example, it should be possible and easy for somebody else to provide statistics and topology information to the relevant manager.\n\n--Colin\n\nOn Mon, Jan 12, 2015 at 11:39 AM, Abhijit Kumbhare <abhijitkoss at gmail.com<mailto:abhijitkoss at gmail.com>> wrote:\nAdding the controller-dev to this thread as well. To expand on what Michal alluded to about my thought regarding the OF-specific apps: it is possible for some one to use the OF-plugin but not use the L2 switch. So it should not be mandatory for them to need to include the L2 switch. By OF-specific apps (just so no one is confused) - Michal means what many people call NSFs:\n\n?  statistics-manager\n?  forwardingrules-manager\n?  inventory-manager\n?  topology-lldp-discovery\n?  topology-manager\nSo I think these should be either in the controller, OF-plugin or a separate new place (but not L2 switch).\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 12, 2015 at 11:24 AM, Michal Rehak -X (mirehak - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco) <mirehak at cisco.com<mailto:mirehak at cisco.com>> wrote:\nHi Colin,\nthere was already discussion about renaming those apps so we do not block some good general name (like NSF).\nAnd yes - we might later come up with some more general modeling here which would be shareable by multiple protocols or at least apps. And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.\n\nNow Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:\nThose apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?\n\n\nRegards,\nMichal\n________________________________\nFrom: Colin Dixon [colin at colindixon.com<mailto:colin at colindixon.com>]\nSent: Monday, January 12, 2015 19:47\nTo: Robert Varga -X (rovarga - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco)\nCc: Raghurama Bhat; Michal Rehak -X (mirehak - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco); release at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org>; openflowplugin-dev; Moiz Raja (moraja); aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; Jan Medved (jmedved); Ed Warnicke (eaw); l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\n\nSubject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that the FRM is currently very OF-oriented, the idea that some of what we were calling \"Network Service Functions\" end up getting migrated to being inside a specific plugin does feel wrong.\n\nAs long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed and reimplemented by others, I guess it's fine to move them from the controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.\n\n--Colin\n\nOn Thursday, January 8, 2015, Robert Varga -X (rovarga - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco) <rovarga at cisco.com<mailto:rovarga at cisco.com>> wrote:\nHello Raghu,\n\nI am a bit worried about ?protocol-agnostic? bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.\n\nFRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.\n\nInventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).\n\nBye,\nRobert\n\n\nFrom: Raghurama Bhat [mailto:raghu.odl at gmail.com<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>]\nSent: Thursday, January 08, 2015 5:58 AM\nTo: Michal Rehak -X (mirehak - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco); release at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>\nCc: openflowplugin-dev; aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>; groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>; affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>; l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx>; Jan Medved (jmedved); Robert Varga -X (rovarga - Pantheon Technologies SRO at Cisco); Ed Warnicke (eaw); Moiz Raja (moraja)\nSubject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo\n\nHi,\n\nIf there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.\n\nSome of these make complete sense to me.

Are you planning to upstream your custom plugin for circuit switching to OpenDaylight?\n      Our Plugin does not really cover all the features of the Circuit Switch Specification. It has the functionality which is required for our switch. Does this partial implementation really add value if we upstream (and also using AD-SAL)?\n2. Are you using the MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (plugin & FRM) or are you using the AD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (the OpenFlow 1.0 protocol plugin, FRM, etc.)?\n        We decided to go with Hydrogen Release and AD-SAL as Helium was still not released. We used the ?Extensions to the OpenFlow Protocol in support of Circuit Switching? (Addendum to OpenFlow Protocol Specification (v1.0) ? Circuit Switch Addendum v0.3). We would like to move to MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation but with the current priority work items, it may take some time to do this. We still have no time frame for that.\n3. Can you elaborate the rough design that you are using the FRM? Will be great if you can share an architecture diagram.\n       The design is same as the Openflow protocol. I am sharing the user guide to get an idea on how I am using the FRM.\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 12, 2015 at 5:35 PM, Aneesha Pailla <apailla at calient.net<mailto:apailla at calient.net>> wrote:\nHi All,\n\nI see interesting conversation here on the services being separated from Openflow.\nThought my experience may add some value to this discussion.\nI was new to ODL and checked stub, SNMP4SDN and OpenFlow plugins and wrote a new custom plugin for a circuit switch where I reused the following services -\n?  forwardingrules-manager\n?  inventory-manager\n?  topology-manager\nI could use topology and inventory manager very well. I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.\nI could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.\nI could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.\nBasically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.\nSo, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.\n\nIt may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.\nAlso, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.\n\nJust my thoughts.\nCorrect me if I am wrong in any of the above.\n\nThanks,\nAneesha\n\nFrom: controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org> [mailto:controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev-bounces at lists.opendaylight.org>] On Behalf Of Raghurama Bhat\nSent: Monday, January 12, 2015 3:46 PM\nTo: Colin Dixon; Abhijit Kumbhare\nCc: openflowplugin-dev; groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:groupbasedpolicy-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:ovsdb-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; release at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org>; affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:affinity-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>; Ed Warnicke (eaw); l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:l2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\n\nSubject: Re: [controller-dev] [openflowplugin-dev] [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo\n\nI agree that L2 switch is not a logical home for  generic network services as long as the project is called L2 Switch.

I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.\n\nSome of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.\n\nHowever, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?\n\n  *   forwardingrules-manager\n  *   inventory-manager\n  *   topology-manager\nAnother reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.\n\nBTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more?

And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.\n\nWith applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.\n\n\n\nThere are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards,\n\nMichal\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________ L2switch-dev mailing list L2switch-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<http://UrlBlockedError.aspx> https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/l2switch-dev\n\n_______________________________________________\nopenflowplugin-dev mailing list\nopenflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:openflowplugin-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>\nhttps://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/openflowplugin-dev\n\n\n_______________________________________________ controller-dev mailing list controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org<mailto:controller-dev at lists.opendaylight.org> https://lists.opendaylight.org/mailman/listinfo/controller-dev\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20150113/2fccf050/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: CalientOCSOpenDaylightPlugin.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 621168 bytes\nDesc: CalientOCSOpenDaylightPlugin.docx\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/affinity-dev/attachments/20150113/2fccf050/attachment-0001.docx>\n"

It is just that, One would not think to look at Open Flow Plugin\nfor generic network services.  For some of these services, I can understand\nthe model being the only thing common/generic and each southbound plugin\npotentially supplying its own implementation.

You are using only a very small subset of the flow actions compared to\nwhat the OpenFlow 1.3 FRM supports\n3.

Also if and when\nyou migrate your custom plugin to MD-SAL as well as open source it -\nperhaps you can help out in abstracting out the parts of the OpenFlow 1.3\nMD-SAL based FRM which are not OpenFlow specific (and can be reused by your\nplugin).\n4.

If your project has no plans for any future active development, project committers can vote to move a project to the Archived State by a Termination Review according to the OpenDaylight Project Lifecycle and Releases document [1].\n2. If you projects plans to remain active, does it intend to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release as documented in the Boron Release Plan [2]?  If not, could someone please publicly decline to participate with a message like so: \"The <PROJECT_NAME> project is formally declining to participate in the Boron SR\".\n\nThe last project related activity on Gerrit is Apr 28, 2014.\n\nBest Regards,\nAn Ho\n\n[1] https://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases\n[2] https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Boron_Release_Plan\n\n\n\n\n"
