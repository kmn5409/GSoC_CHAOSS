*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Guys,
    As  I suggested here:
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/discuss/2014-May/002616.html
I'm willing to provide a helping hand to new projects looking to get going with the ODL
infra (setup Jenkins jobs etc).  I didn't get any direct response back to that email, but the SNBI team
was interested in doing it Friday morning at 9am.  I wanted to throw this open to any new project committers
who'd like to show up to also work on infra setup for their projects.


       Expect a bit of chaos, as it will be folks working on getting stuff done live, but hopefully folks will find it useful :)


       It may be useful to preview:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Project_Main


       Its not as complete as I'd like... but its something to start chewing on :)


In addition I would strongly recommend that folks turn up in #opendaylight-meeting on IRC
as well :)


Ed

	At the AAA meeting this week, as Liem was walking us through the code, he showed us attaching
security context to an InheritableThreadLocal store (meaning, its context is the thread or its children).
	We talked a bit about how that interacts with thread pools and executors where you may pass
work from one thread to another, but not by spawning new threads.  I had mused about that being worrisome
to me, because it requires folks to get it right at many many places in the code every time work is passed between
threads, but that I didn?t have a smarter idea, and that might be the state of what could be done. (which is to say, as a matter of personal
technical opinion I made mild grumbly noises, but couldn?t be constructive about helping to move things
forward and so appropriately didn?t press it much past making my grumble known ;) ).

	I still don?t have a better way? but was curious if other folks had any thoughts/experience to share as to 
other options and the tradeoffs in them?

I missed that meeting and thus don't have context, but my first question
is why do you need to do this at all?  That is, in my world-view, the
incoming northbound request is steered to the appropriate service for
processing.  That service is responsible to enforcing access-control, and
does so without other services needing to do any additional enforcement.

For instance, let's say you have a service that can generate pretty CIO
reports off data persisted by an analytics service.  Furthermore, let's
say that the particular user sending the request is only allowed to see a
subset of the data (e.g. tenant==""pepsi"" && device-type==""firewall"").  So
we might have:

   User         Reporting Service          Analytics Service
    |                   |                          |

    |                   |                          |
    |                   |                          |

So no need for an internal call to pass a security context.   Can it not
be the same here?

14,Pipermail,message,"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 18:38:53 -0400",jdennis at redhat.com (John Dennis),<539F71FD.9050106@redhat.com>,"Hi Liem:

Thank you for sending out the sequence diagrams, they've been very
helpful. Also thank you for posting the code to a public git repo. The
code looks clean, nicely organized and professionally written. I've been
going through the code to get a better understanding of the overarching
architecture and I've got a few questions.

My first question is an organizational one, I noticed you've been
sending your emails with design information to specific individuals
instead of the aaa-dev list, is there a reason? FWIW I've sent this mail
to both the individuals you've been emailing *and* the aaa-dev list.
Should we be using the aaa-dev list from this point on?

The Framework Overview (https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa) is clear
that authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) are two
independent concepts and derive from independent sources of authority.
This is good, authn and authz should be separate.

But when I look at the code it looks to me as if authn and authz have
been conflated. I draw this conclusion by looking at the fields in the
Claim and Authentication types. An identity claim is something returned
by a trusted IdP (Identity Provider) which attests to the identity and
attributes bound to that identity by the IdP. It appears as if the Claim
type is being used for this purpose in the code. However the Claim type
also includes tenant and role information. An independent IdP will not
(or should not) have information specific to ODL. This is especially
true for roles, only ODL should know what the roles are and which
identities possess those roles. [1]

Perhaps I've misread the code (please correct me) but it looks as if
ClaimAuthFilter via the ClaimAuth.transform() method is supposed to map
from an IdP identity assertion to a Claim object. What is confusing me
is how or why would an external authn assertion know anything about the
ODL roles in order to populate the roles in the Claim object? [2]

It seems to me there needs to be a separate mapping stage which maps
from an identity assertion to ODL specific information such as tenant
and roles. As an example you might want to look at how Keystone handles
the federated case
(https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/blob/master/v3/src/markdown/identity-api-v3-os-federation-ext.md).
In the Keystone federation architecture one binds an (IdP, protocol)
2-tuple to a mapping which maps from IdP attributes to those used
internally (i.e. groups, roles, etc.)

Going back to the code and the sequence diagrams shouldn't there be an
IdentityClaim (does not yet exist) which is passed to a mapping endpoint
(does not yet exist) which returns a Claim instead of the
ClaimAuthFilter attempting to assign roles and return a Claim?

Also, I'm not sure why we have the DirectAuth case as a special case
code path and flow. Couldn't the code be simplified if DirectAuth was an
instance of the federated case? Here the internal DirecAuth ""toy"" IdP
only does username/password authn and the roles are provided by a
mapping? Fewer code paths usually means more robust code.

I'm sure I have a slew of misunderstandings about how the actually code
works :-) Feel free to set me straight.

Thanks again for the great code and excellent diagrams!

John


[1] Allowing an IdP to attach a role to an identity is a security
concern. You may trust an IdP to authenticate a user but do you really
want to trust that IdP to also claim that user has the admin role in
your service? It may be case that you trust *some* IdP's to assign roles
but that should be configurable and off by default. I suspect the
DirectAuth case is one such example (correct?)

[2] It almost looks as if the authz processing is supposed to happen in
TokenEndpoint.createAccessToken() where the else clause says

// TODO: Support authorization code later...

but if the claim filters are setting the roles (which is my definition
of authz) then what authorization code is going to execute here?

I don't suggest hard-coding mapping logics... It should be some sort of JSON mapping file; there just won't be any API for it, unless someone has the bandwidth.  For user/role assignment, we use the internal IdM APIs--Peter perhaps can go through that with us at the next presentation.

First, apologies for the major email blast, but pretty much everybody gets
covered by this one...

Second, apologies if I missed any projects that declared intent to be part
of helium - I'm not 100% sure I have the ODL-SDNi folks and several other
projects really should update their project pages (hint hint hint).  In
addition, I'm pretty sure I've missed the southbound to OC, reservation,
and toolkit folks, because I don't see a mailing list for them anywhere,
nor do I see information about a topic to use on dev on any of their wiki
pages

Third, not to call out the reservation project further, but I looked at the
project wiki page and I have *no* clue how/where reservation fits, so this
project isn't currently part of this discussion.  Consider this a major
hint to help me help you...

================

During last week's TSC call, I took the action item of beginning the RV
discussion for Helium.  After spending the weekend looking at the
twenty-five projects that have declared their intent to participate, what
made the most sense to me as a starting point was to propose the following
five RVs:

1. A Minimal edition, which is *NOT* guaranteed to work out of the box, but
provides the base framework for research projects.
2. A Base edition, which is intended to work out of the box and so has most
of the SB plug-ins
3. An SDN edition, which is intended to work in various SDN environments
4. An Intent edition, which is intended to work in situations where ""intent
is being managed""
5. A Full edition, which is basically the kitchen sink.

The buildup in my mind is

Minimal --- Base ---(split)-- SDN/Intent --(combine)-- Full

This draft list can be found on the Helium Release Plan page at
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Helium_Release_Plan#Proposed_Release_Vehicles
 where each entry is a link that will take you to a one-line description
and an image showing what projects are part of that RV.

I'm going to ask that rather than reply to the entire distribution list
(because it is almost the entire ODL community), that folks reply to
tsc at opendaylight.org with comments and suggestions...

Thanks, and let the comments begin.

here's the initial authorization model, that I would like to propose for
starters. Key inputs exected to be provided by the AuthN sub-system are:
role and domain-name.
The idea is that the AuthZ system would use these and run an authorization
check against the service, designated by service-name, that has triggered
the AuthZ action.

The model allows for chaining of authz policies, via an ordered list of
references to such policies.

The simple-authorization node is there for demo purposes only - it forms
the core domain-agnostic authz policy model, which would be reusable by
components wishing to extend it, etc.

module: authorization-data-schema
   +--rw domain-authorizations
   |  +--rw domains* [domain-name]
   |     +--rw domain-name           domain-type
   |     +--rw policies* [service action]
   |     |  +--rw service      service-type
   |     |  +--rw action       action-type
   |     |  +--rw resources    resource-type
   |     |  +--rw role         role-type
   |     +--rw authz-domain-chain* [domain-name]
   |        +--rw domain-name    leafref
   +--rw simple-authorization
      +--rw policies* [service action]
         +--rw service      service-type
         +--rw action       action-type
         +--rw resources    resource-type

while working through the config sub-system wiring, I came to a question
that calls for some wider input. As far as I understand, there are two
types of wiring API ends that can be used a) Yang RPC derived b) manually
defined. (The Toaster model exemplifies only the former)
Now, the advantage of the former is that the wiring automatically gets made
with other services, eg RestConf. But it occured to me, is this necessary
for the AuthZ service, i.e. would we want to expose the AuthZ service to
external queries arriving over REST of the type: Can user X perform Y on Z?

Thoughts?

Cheers,
Wojciech.

given that this is an initial model, I'm collecting your feedback on, and
mindful of the fact that Yang syntax might be new to some, here's some
additional description.

The Yang model consists of two main data structures:
- A simple Authorization node: This contains the key/basic authorization
data model, in the form of a list that is keyed by a ""service"" and
""action"". More on these later one
- A domain authorization node: This contains a list of the basic
authorizations, but in a per domain form, with the key being a domain. In
addition, for each list item, there is an additional list,
authz-domain-chain, containing an ordered list of references to additional
domain policies that are applicable for this domain.

The ""service"" data item, is intended to respresent an ODL service component
that is effectively invoking an authZ request. Eg, if an authN user,
joe at foo.com is making some request via the REST interface, the ""service""
would be REST(conf). If the same user was doing a request over Netconf, the
""service"" would be Netconf. Naturally, we need to arrive at some naming
convention for services, perhaps bundle names.
The ""action"" is an item off the enumerated list (crud, none, all)
representing the requested action. With this model client would be
responsible for mapping their service specific request (eg PUT) to such an
action (eg create).

About the Authz chain. The list is user-ordered, meaning that the order of
the entries is intended to be set by the writer into that list. I'm
thinking that one likely chain would be to actually make this list an
explicitly priority ordered list, by introducing a ""priority"" data item.
The API to the AuthZ service engine is not captured by the above model, but
that will be a next step if we agree that the above is a decent base.

Example of an AuthZ chain: Suppose foo.com is using the services of bar.com,
who in term use abc.com. Each of the ""lower tier"" providers would represent
their customer policies as customers.bar.com and customers.abc.com.

When joe at foo.com makes a request to read X using service Y, the conceptual
AuthZ service engine would use the data from the foo.com entry on the
domain-authz list, to evaluate in a first instance the authz for foo.com as
key. Finding that this policy contains an ordered list comprised of
customers.bar.com and customers.abc.com, each of those policies are
retrieved from the domain-authz list (using customers.bar.com and
customers.abc.com as key).

Conceptually the data model does not deal with conflict resolution, leaving
such processing to the service engine. Alternatively policy conflict
resolution  checks could be be applied upon policy insertion. The data
model is neutral to which of these methods is chosen.

Welcome your feedback.

Regards,
Wojciech.

I don?t really see a use-case for exposing AuthZ via REST?  In fact, I think it might be a security issue, since it exposes too much of the inner workings of the AAA system for a potential hacker if they get a hold of this information.  From the resource owner?s perspective, they should already know what kind of accesses they should get with the given role(s).

Basically all entries on this datastore should be done only programmatically by my Provide-consumer code using the Yang generated APIs.
 Is there a way to do that today?

read access) for any element in the model. In fact, we didn't even create a

extensions in place that limit the exposure of some part of the data tree
via protocol X,  access would be still allowed to it via internal APIs
which will inevitably see someone implement a protocol Y that uses such
internal APIs. The AAA project is meant to address this by allowing
authorizations to be set not only in terms of the ""role"" of a user (say
admin) but also the ""app"" that is accessing the data. Current data model is
described in:
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/aaa-dev/2014-July/000036.html

Thus, the lack of meta-extensions to Yang data models to cover ""data
exposure"", can generally be a said to be a good thing if we assume that the
data is meant to be accessed using multiple protocols which are not/should
not be the concern of the data-model. If however say REST(Conf) is say the
*only* protocol that we expect to be used (is it?) yang extensions a'la
JAX-RS, etc would be of value.

requirements is the ability to receive attributes from an external IdP
and map them into the roles and other attributes used internally by
OpenDaylight. An administrator will author a set of rules, one for each
external IdP which will defined how the foreign attributes are mapped.

We looked to other authentication/authorization systems for guidance, in
particular Openstack's federation support in Keystone and my experience
with RADIUS.

I would like you to review the proposed solution which is documented here:

http://jdennis.fedorapeople.org/federated_mapping/mapping.html

I have a working proof-of-concept implementation written in Python
(because Python is the language of OpenStack and this will also be
proposed for OpenStack and because I was able to do rapid prototyping in
Python allowing me to flesh out ideas quickly). Provided the proposal is
acceptable the idea is to implement it in Java. If the proposal is also
accepted in OpenStack I'll likely maintain 2 parallel implementations,
one in Python and one in Java.

You may find it instructional to initially read this introductory
document which explains the rationale for the approach taken and
possible alternatives.

http://jdennis.fedorapeople.org/federated_mapping/strategy.html

You will note I discuss 2 different possible solutions, scripts and
rules. The above proposal is rule based because several people I had
discussions with felt scripts were an advanced feature and I should
concentrate on something simpler. As you can see from the proposal I'm
not sure the rule based system is simpler to implement or use. In fact
I'm still of the opinion a script based system is easier to implement,
easier to use and will have fewer potential bugs.

I like the template/rule-based approach for its simplicity; however, I think that we should limit its functionality to just sed/awk type transformation, because going beyond that (like embedding control/flow logics) makes it more complicated and diminishes the promised simplicity benefit of this approach...  Kinda reminds me of assembly language and microcode <shiver/> :)

However, I do recognize that for some ""real-world"" use-cases, we may have a need for control logics.  In these cases, my preference would be to use a scripting language that I am familiar with to express control logics rather than using JSON (which is intended to be a data exchange format, after all), for all the reasons you mentioned, including debuggability.

So, I think we can start out with just a set of awk/sed type rules to do simple transformations but also allow additional (pluggable) rules to be defined and evaluated elsewhere in an external script.  Not sure if you have looked into it, but Java does have a built-in Javascript engine that you can use to execute Javascript from within the JVM.  Java 6/7 uses the Rhino engine, while Java 8 uses the Nashorn engine which is supposed to be faster than Rhino:

http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2014/03/nashorn-the-new-rhino-on-the-block.html

As for security, we should be able to leverage Karaf security to gate access to the bundle that loads the script, assuming the embedded script engine is used.

Liem

Subject: [Aaa-dev] Federated IdP attribute mapping proposal



I've been working on adding federated authentication. One of the requirements is the ability to receive attributes from an external IdP and map them into the roles and other attributes used internally by OpenDaylight. An administrator will author a set of rules, one for each external IdP which will defined how the foreign attributes are mapped.



We looked to other authentication/authorization systems for guidance, in particular Openstack's federation support in Keystone and my experience with RADIUS.



I would like you to review the proposed solution which is documented here:



http://jdennis.fedorapeople.org/federated_mapping/mapping.html



I have a working proof-of-concept implementation written in Python (because Python is the language of OpenStack and this will also be proposed for OpenStack and because I was able to do rapid prototyping in Python allowing me to flesh out ideas quickly). Provided the proposal is acceptable the idea is to implement it in Java. If the proposal is also accepted in OpenStack I'll likely maintain 2 parallel implementations, one in Python and one in Java.



You may find it instructional to initially read this introductory document which explains the rationale for the approach taken and possible alternatives.



http://jdennis.fedorapeople.org/federated_mapping/strategy.html



You will note I discuss 2 different possible solutions, scripts and rules. The above proposal is rule based because several people I had discussions with felt scripts were an advanced feature and I should concentrate on something simpler. As you can see from the proposal I'm not sure the rule based system is simpler to implement or use. In fact I'm still of the opinion a script based system is easier to implement, easier to use and will have fewer potential bugs.

I have worked with some other members of the community to map a proposal that would define the relationships in ODL among AAA, tenants, virtual networks, and group based policy. It has generally been well received when socialized, but we?ve not yet figured out how to translate this concept into cooperation and code within all the projects that would need to participate.

Clearly not happening for Helium and possibly a great thing to work on when broad community membership is face-to-face at September developer event.

In todays GBP requirements call we will discuss plans to align GBP and AAA with this proposed approach.

Below are links to some documents from the discussion to date. They may help you understand the direction we?re proposing, however they may require some narration by the authors. We?ve presented some of this on TWS previously and could do an update to TWS if that is of interest.


https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/e/e3/OS-ODL_Mapping.pdf

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/a/a0/TWS-ODL-tenancy-preso-2014-06-02.pdf


It?s not yet  clear to me  how we staff the developers to implement long term architectural vision across projects in ODL. Folks with interest/availability to participate should raise their hands as we begin to think about long term improvements outside of the helium timeline.



Below is pasted an email from the discuss list discussing this as well

Since the first ODL Hackfest, we?ve been trying to figure out how to get on the same page about terminology and how we can use it to talk about what we?re building.
This spring, Colin Dixon, Liem Nguyen, and I took an action to propose a way to map AAA tools to some well defined entities and in the process to resolve ongoing confusion around what we mean by tenants, users, and virtual networks, in particular.
We presented this and got some good feedback from the TWS call on June 2.

What we proposed was a model with an entity called a domain (chosen by poll) that works as follows:

The ?root? domain is created when the GBP system starts and it inherits access to  all of the physical and virtual network resources discovered by the startup process.
The root domain can include various users and roles with AAA support. Within the root domain an admin can be created and can then subsequently define which resources and actions the various root domain users are allowed to access.
The root domain can create one or more children, and for each can specify what resources and actions are available in the childrens ?view? of the overall resource and policy world.
The parent child relationship can be extended recursively to an arbitrary depth.
Each child  domain also has a set of users and roles supported by AAA that are local to that domain. These define what various users are allowed to do withing the resource/policy view they inherit.


Email included below describes the vision of how this would work in general.
The OpenStack project, which will often sit atop ODL (and GBP) does not support arbitrarily deep recursion of ?tenant like? entities. It is basically a one-deep hierarchy. Enclosed slides show how multiple instances of OpenStack provider/tenants could map onto a single instance of the recursive ODL network infrastructure model.

Within Group Based Policy it would be fantastic if we could figure out how to make GBP the policy language for describing the concentric circles of  ever-more restrictive ?parental controls? as one marches down the ODL domain stack.

Suggest we discuss this in a GBP arch meeting at a minimum. May touch enough areas that we want to discuss on TWS again?

I?ve uploaded some slides that help explain the thinking on the GBP Wiki

Subject: Expanding on N-deep tenant hierarchy

Some folks have asked me to restate my vision for how/why we need a flexible tenant concept. Please note that

One could imagine a strict hierarchy of control as follows in which each subsequent tenant entity has authority/scope/role defined and limited by it?s parent/child relationship through which it inherits a constrained view of the total resource pool.


Facitlities Based Provider ? Owns switches, servers, fibre, etc.
    Virtual Cloud Provider ? Sells access to a subset of the resources offered by FBP parent
        Corporate Customer ? provides corporate wide access to subset of  resources offered by VCP parent
            Business unit of Corporation ? provides on-demand self-service access to subset of resources offered by CC parent
                Admin in business Unit ? provides on-demand, self-service access to subset of BU resources
                    BU developer ? consumes on-demand, self-service subset of BU resources
                        BU production application ? consumes resources as defined by developer with elastics scaleout-based on load.
                            Application module ? can do stuff within envelope of BUA parent.
                                Etc.

In this case N=8, but the instant we decide that is the right constant, somebody will come up with a good reason for 9. If we decide N=25 to have lot?s of headroom we will feel dumb some day.
I claim we need an architecture that allows for a hierarchy that is arbitrarily deep.


FBP can decide that VCP 1 gets 80 of the bandwidth in the physical fabric and VCP 2 gets 20%, but with special express links between metro hubs.
VCP one can sell  LargeCo access to some dedicated resources and an ability to burst on-demand up to a limit X in a shared pool.
LargeCo can define which virtual networks are accessible to the Finance BU
FinBU can allow admin to choose developers who are allowed to request Gold QoS on their diffserv vnet
BU dev can contain the number of instances of paystubprinter allowed on-demand.
PayStubPrinter FinBU app can decide how/when to load balance across multi-link border interface
App module can stream log data within storage contstraints from FinBU (great-grand-parent)
Etc.

Above is kind of goofy contrived example, so please send nit picking to /dev/null.

Point is Tenancy cannot be flat, or shallow, but must be supported for potential complex hierarchy of control.

Within the hierarchy, the limits of what a child can do are always defined buy inheritance from their parent.


Authentication at any level of the hierarchy could be to a common, multi-tenant aware auth server or to an instance of auth-server with constrained/local context (e.g. FinBU auth server for FinBU and children).

Do others feel that this vision is sensible and needs to get reflected in our requirements?

It won?t surprise anyone that I think we need to build the enforcement of the rules of such a hierarchy into a controller based declarative intent NBI. I would suggest that the single writer of policy be the only trusted client of a completely trusted NBI and that the entire hierarchy of control and enforcement be built above that trusted interface.  As others have recommended, the controller would have no native sense of tenancy in the management/control plane (there are clearly requirements, e.g. overlapping tenant IP address spaces that need to be handled in tenant context in the data plane). The intent NBI would become the single-sign-on interface for AAA for non-infrastructure entities (e.g. securing controller-native bunldles and interfaces needs it?s own secure plumbing solution).

If folks want to talk me out of a single policy writer completely trusted, I won?t be surprised (and I?m sure the reasons will be compelling), but  the top of the plumbing AAA/policy stack needs to connect to the bottom of the intent based NBI stack cleanly with no AAA ambiguity.

I?m donning my flame retardant suit as I hit send and await our communities diverse views on my wacky vision of the future. Be gentle friends.

the currently proposed AuthZ service data-model + API factor in a
multi-tenancy aspect by allowing authorization policies for resources to be

AAA comes a built-in IdM server with a set of REST API to manage users/roles/domains.  You can use this API to validate credentials from your service, basically passing in  username/password/domain and getting back a set of roles for that user on the given domain.  You can then do further authorization if needed in your service.  

More details on the IdM APIs here (Sorry, we are working on getting more formal documentation than a spreadsheet):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYMmK_V5LMAjLGZOEjfKSX0x4Gwb-K5Xuk1wZskwWwY/edit#gid=0

This work is not yet checked in, since we are still working on integrating it into Karaf (having issue with JAXB/JSON in Karaf)...

While we are working on integrating the IdM server (almost there!), this is the service you can obtain from OSGi to do the authentication:



https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/CredentialAuth.java



Currently, the only credential AAA supports out-of-the-box for direct authentication is username/password:  PasswordCredentials<https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/PasswordCredentials.java>.



Please let me know if you have any questions...

Here are the steps I go through to get AAA installed on Karaf (the install stuff should go into the installation guide later, but at least just the contents for now):


1.       Build the AAA code

2.       Grab the controller code (git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/controller.git)

3.       Build it!

4.       cd opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target/assembly

5.       bin/karaf (you may need to chmod u+x it)

6.       Add AAA repo (within karaf shell):  repo-add mvn:org.opendaylight.aaa/features-aaa/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/xml/features

7.       List ODL features:  feature:list | grep odl  (you should see aaa in there as well).  There are 4 aaa features:

a.       odl-aaa-authn (Authentication feature)

b.      odl-aaa-authn-sssd (Authentication with SSSD)

c.       odl-aaa-authz (Authorization feature)

d.      odl-aaa-all (AAA features-includes all the above)

8.       You can then install any listed feature.  Example:  feature:install odl-aaa-authn

9.       Sanity check to see if AAA is up:  issue a token request:  curl -si -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=odl&scope=pepsi' http://localhost:8181/oauth2/token

10.   If that above returns an error, something is wrong:  check the log under opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight-karaf/target/assembly/data/log.  You can also issue log:display in the Karaf shell and grep for stuff as well.

If you make your changes to your code, after rebuilding, you can refresh the repo in the Karaf shell by:


1.       Feature:uninstall <your feature>

2.       Repo-refresh

3.       Feature:install <your feature>

There may be a better way to hot deploy your code, but I don't know how to do it yet...  If you do, please speak up :).

Other useful things I find in Karaf shell:


1.       Web:list (show you all the web endpoints you have)

2.       Feature:install webconsole (this installs the web console at http://localhost:8181/system/console/ username:karaf/password:karaf)  This provides a great tool to see how things are wired, what services/bundles/features are available, configuration, etc... tons of stuff.


For checking in your code, this Wiki page is a good start:  https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Pulling,_Hacking,_and_Pushing_All_the_Code_from_the_CLI

After the setup as shown by the above wiki page, check-in process should be as simple as:


1.       Git checkout -b <your topic branch name>

2.       Git commit -a -s -m ""comments for your checkin""

3.       Git review

4.       Go to Gerrit and invite at least 1 reviewer to review your code

Cheers,
Liem

We have a bundle.  The bundle gets user credentials.  It needs to via a java service ask the AuthN to whether
those credentials are valid or not (and what roles they correspond to).

How would we do that?

This looks like an API Maros (CC?d) will need to migrate the NETCONF bits away from AD-SAL.

Hi Robert,

While we are working on integrating the IdM server (almost there!), this is the service you can obtain from OSGi to do the authentication:

https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/CredentialAuth.java

Currently, the only credential AAA supports out-of-the-box for direct authentication is username/password:  PasswordCredentials<https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/PasswordCredentials.java>.

Please let me know if you have any questions?

Regards,
Liem

No, we don't have any formal doc on that yet (will be Javadoc as soon as we get the IdM server integrated); but, it will be part of the OSGi IdmService.  I will provide more developer info as soon as this gets integrated (hopefully) this week.

Netconf in ODL still uses old UserManager service from AD-SAL.
I'd be happy to replace it with your API/Implementation for user/password authentication.

Hi Liem,

Netconf in ODL still uses old UserManager service from AD-SAL.
I'd be happy to replace it with your API/Implementation for user/password authentication.

But I have a few questions for you/Robert/Ed:
Do we want to do it in Helium or later (not too much time until code freeze) ?
Are your bundles (Api/Implementation) part of ODL base distribution or will they be ?

Hi Ed,

So? the bundle would:

1.       Get a reference to the org.opendaylight.aaa.api.CredentialAuth service from OSGi.
2.       Call the authenticate() method on the service, passing in the user credentials (username/password)
3.       The call will return back a Claim object, consisting of:
a.       Client id (if known)
b.      User id
c.       User name
d.      Domain name
e.      User roles
If the credentials are not valid, a runtime AuthenticationException will be thrown.

How would we do that?

Hi Robert,

While we are working on integrating the IdM server (almost there!), this is the service you can obtain from OSGi to do the authentication:

https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/CredentialAuth.java

Currently, the only credential AAA supports out-of-the-box for direct authentication is username/password:  PasswordCredentials<https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa/blob/master/aaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/PasswordCredentials.java>.

Please let me know if you have any questions?

The snapshot is available in Nexus...  The AuthN piece is working 100%; the IdM backend is being integrated (so not yet checked in)... Hopefully, it will be in earlier this week.  For testing, you can just use the canned user (admin/odl).

I think we can worry about the md-sal authz piece later, since we don't have it for Helium anyways.  So... let's focus on AuthN.

For AuthN, I really don't want it to depend on other controller components, because let's say if the netconf bundle fails to load for instance, then we won't have AuthN.  Having direct dependency from netconf to AuthN would also keep things simpler too.

Thoughts, Ed/Tony?

1. ODL: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/10318/ Extracted AuthProvider SPI bundle, Extracted UserManager backed AuthProvider into separate bundle
2. AAA: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/10356/ Implemented AuthProvider SPI interface backed by CredentialAuth service.

Please review

Maros

Subject: RE: AuthN and netconf-tcp, netconf-ssh
Hi Maros,

Sounds good...  Just a clarification:  only the odl-aaa-authz feature/bundles (AuthZ) depend on ODL; the odl-aaa-authn feature/bundles (AuthN) do not.  So, an alternative is we could have the AuthZ reside with the ODL codebase...  AuthZ, of course, would depend on AuthN.  Thoughts on the 2 different approaches?  I personally like the fact that AuthZ should reside as close to the business/service layer as possible, since it ultimately understands the service logics for authorization.

Thanks,
Liem

Subject: RE: AuthN and netconf-tcp, netconf-ssh

Talked to Tony,

He said that we cannot introduce a direct dependency in ODL to the AAA bundles. AAA bundles depend on ODL bundles and we would introduce a cyclic dependency that would cause problems when bumping version of ODL bundles during release or otherwise (since AAA is not part of ODL base repository).
He suggested that we introduce a new bundle in ODL with SPI for Authentication Service for Netconf. It would serve as an interface between ODL netconf and Authentication Service implementations. Then there would be 2 implementations:
- AD-SAL UserManager (we would extract UserManager related code and all AD-SAL dependencies there so it can be easily replaceable)
- Liem's implementation (this implementation would be hosted in AAA repository and would replace the first implementation in distributions)

So what do you say to that approach ?
We would have to introduce new interface to ODL (only SPI but still, its API freeze)
Liem would still have to bump the version of ODL they use and release their bundles.

Maros

Here're the steps I usually take to verify if some libraries/code I have added for AAA still works in Karaf:


1.       Run the local unit tests and feature tests:

a.       mvn clean install (root pom)

b.      Go to distribution-karaf:  bin/karaf

c.       In Karaf shell:  feature:install odl-aaa-all

d.      Do your testing (sorry still working on automated integration tests):  Example (create a token):  curl -s -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin&scope=coke' http://localhost:8181/oauth2/token

2.        After merging (gerrit +2), you can also try running the latest AAA on the integration branch also (git clone ssh://${ODL_USERNAME}@git.opendaylight.org:29418/integration.git)

a.       rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/

b.       In integration project:  mvn clean install

Cheers,
Liem

PS:  In case, you are not aware, code freeze has been postponed to 9/4 in the TSC call this morning.

That won't work when an artifact is new and not in nexus yet; we can only find out only after the merge.  Is there a better way?

Hi AAA project,

As written in the following page, if you execute ""mvn install"" for features-aaa with an empty local maven repository,
you can easily find these missing dependencies.

  rm ~/.m2/repository/org/opendaylight/
  mvn clean install

Subject: [controller-dev] Code Freeze

Guys,
We are now past the Code Freeze Milestone.

I would propose we handle code freeze in the following way:

1)  Have a Bug: All Gerrits should be submitted with a bug, indicated by the first line of the summary
message starting with 'Bug ####'
2)  No Bug No Review: No patch should be considered for review without a bug so indicated, a simple comment on the Gerrit to notify the submitter should suffice
3)  Bugs not Features: Bugs considered for merge should be actual bugs, not feature enhancements.
4)  Mark Features Post-Helium: Gerrits that are known to not meet criteria #3 should be marked topic 'post-Helium'
    This is because perfectly lovely patches that don't meet #3 should be deferred, not rejected.

Ed

Subject: [release] ?Important?TSC decisions for Helium RC1 milestone.

Hello,

In today?s TSC meeting, there are some important decisions made that will have impact to all projects from release?s point of view:

AGREED: midnight UTC for time of day to cut RC1
AGREED: we will cut from the same branches for RC1& RC2 as we did for RC0 (mostly master, but some projects may be on other branches as noted above)
AGREED: all projects *must* cut helium/stable branches on or before 9/29 (this was agreed on in the past, but reiterated here)
AGREED: the criteria for RC1 shall be 1) karaf features successfully merged to integration, and 2) you must be code frozen
AGREED: If a project does not meet the criteria for RC1, the project will be dropped from the Helium Release

For details, please refer to:
https://meetings.opendaylight.org/opendaylight-meeting/2014/tsc/opendaylight-meeting-tsc.2014-09-11-17.01.html

Project contacts please inform me when your project status changed.

Thanks,

George

I have pushed a patch this morning (or rather updated with a bug ID) that fixes some issues with running an ODL build outside of the opendaylight community. If possible could one of you review and push this patch before the RC1 cut ( which I think is tonight midnight UTC? Not positive).

The bug 1874 has more details and you can always reach out to me on IRC and / or e-mail.

FYI... The AAATest now also loads the toaster example and restconf so it can be used for AuthZ testing as well.

Peter, I ended up not using the Apache HttpClient, since it is not an OSGi bundle, and wrapping it in PAX-EXAM does not seem to work :\.  So, I ended up using plain-old Java HttpURLConnection which works fine for doing curl stuff.  You can see an example of it in AAATest as well.

Cheers,

PS:  Don't forget to do ""mvn clean install -Paaa-it"" to run integration tests from the root pom.

just wondering; it appears that you removed the opendaylight/commons
dependency as part of a pom cleanup, but that entails that some common
variables that get used in the pom files go undeclared, eg
<config.configfile.directory>etc/opendaylight/karaf</config.configfile.directory>

I filed https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1912
The immediate fix can be as trivial as adding this decalration,  but then
again, shouldn't we be using the od/commons as a parent?

Cheers,

I removed the opendaylight/commons inheritance because I am concerned that we could inadvertently inherit unwanted dependencies from the controller project.  I think we should define all the dependencies we need via Maven dependencies instead, so we know exactly what we are dependent on.

For properties that we need, we can define them in the commons/parent/pom.xml in AAA.   Some of these are probably the same as in the controller project, but because we choose to do so based on the version of the controller that we depend on.  Do you see any issue with this approach?

Thanks,

Subject: opendaylight/commons pom parent

Hi Liem,
just wondering; it appears that you removed the opendaylight/commons dependency as part of a pom cleanup, but that entails that some common variables that get used in the pom files go undeclared, eg <config.configfile.directory>etc/opendaylight/karaf</config.configfile.directory>
I filed https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1912
The immediate fix can be as trivial as adding this decalration,  but then again, shouldn't we be using the od/commons as a parent?
Cheers,
Wojciech.

     Good that I was testing AAA for Authz in karaf and caught this bug. As discussed I have manually added the config property in the pom file and while testing I noticed that I have to add l2switch feature also  then be able to access the topology service. Now I see policy checks all working fine with Authn and Authz models.

Apologies, but I will not be able to join the meeting tomorrow. No updates from me, however I do have one question that perhaps we could discuss/review over email: Next week?s ODL Dev meeting, and our AAA material (if any).

Obvious points for discussion at the meeting are:

  *   AAA clustering
  *   AAA and data persistence.
  *   Accounting
  *   Scoping for Lithium.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at log files.

Hi Folks,

Apologies, but I will not be able to join the meeting tomorrow. No updates from me, however I do have one question that perhaps we could discuss/review over email: Next week's ODL Dev meeting, and our AAA material (if any).

Obvious points for discussion at the meeting are:

  *   AAA clustering
  *   AAA and data persistence.
  *   Accounting
  *   Scoping for Lithium.
Regards,
Wojciech.

Ah. Ok. Thanks ? I missed that error.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the 
restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I 
would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA 
classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that 
error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may 
have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a 
response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you 
are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the 
sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so 
that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at 
log files.

Can somebody suggest any way by which we can bypass authentication ?

After installing odl-restconf (with the error shared in the email thread), 
when I install my plugin, I am getting the following error. Because of the 
same I cant hit the basic neutron northbound URLs.. Can anyone suggest 
something on this?


Thanks
Priyanka

Have a question related to this discussion- is there a way to turn off 
restconf authentication via configuration properties ?

Ah. Ok. Thanks ? I missed that error.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the 
restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I 
would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA 
classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that 
error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may 
have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a 
response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you 
are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the 
sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so 
that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at 
log files.

The error you saw about TokenAuthFilter not found simply means that there is no AAA installed; so, there won?t be any authentication.  To install authentication with restconf:

feature:install odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf

Both basic and token-based authentication mechanisms are provided with this feature.

Authentication can also be disabled/enabled dynamically by using the Karaf webconsole, config command, or just setting the ?authEnabled? flag to false in the file etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg.

Liem

Hi Priyanka,


Have you tried Basic Authorization?  I noticed failures with our python scripts in recent builds, but adding Basic Authorization fixed this.

cheers,

Can somebody suggest any way by which we can bypass authentication ?

After installing odl-restconf (with the error shared in the email thread), when I install my plugin, I am getting the following error. Because of the same I cant hit the basic neutron northbound URLs.. Can anyone suggest something on this?

Ah. Ok. Thanks ? I missed that error.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at log files.

Problem: The following error is returned when trying to install RESTCONF: The class org.opendaylight.aaa.sts.TokenAuthFilter could not be found.

Solution: The error occurred because AAA is not installed and basic authentication is not in place. To install authentication for use with RESTCONF, run the following command: feature:install odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf
Both basic and token-based authentication mechanisms are provided by this feature.

Note: Authentication can also be disabled/enabled dynamically via:

  *   the Karaf webconsole
  *   the config command
  *   setting the authEnabled parameter to false in the etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg file

Hi Priyanka,

The error you saw about TokenAuthFilter not found simply means that there is no AAA installed; so, there won?t be any authentication.  To install authentication with restconf:

feature:install odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf

Both basic and token-based authentication mechanisms are provided with this feature.

Authentication can also be disabled/enabled dynamically by using the Karaf webconsole, config command, or just setting the ?authEnabled? flag to false in the file etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg.

Hi Priyanka,


Have you tried Basic Authorization?  I noticed failures with our python scripts in recent builds, but adding Basic Authorization fixed this.

cheers,

Can somebody suggest any way by which we can bypass authentication ?

After installing odl-restconf (with the error shared in the email thread), when I install my plugin, I am getting the following error. Because of the same I cant hit the basic neutron northbound URLs.. Can anyone suggest something on this?

Ah. Ok. Thanks ? I missed that error.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at log files.

i can place the following information into the core release notes. please review it and let me know if i need to make any changes before i do so.

Problem: The following error is returned when trying to install RESTCONF: The class org.opendaylight.aaa.sts.TokenAuthFilter could not be found.

Solution: The error occurred because AAA is not installed and basic authentication is not in place. To install authentication for use with RESTCONF, run the following command: feature:install odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf
Both basic and token-based authentication mechanisms are provided by this feature.

Note: Authentication can also be disabled/enabled dynamically via:

  *   the Karaf webconsole
  *   the config command
  *   setting the authEnabled parameter to false in the etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg file

Hi Priyanka,

The error you saw about TokenAuthFilter not found simply means that there is no AAA installed; so, there won?t be any authentication.  To install authentication with restconf:

feature:install odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf

Both basic and token-based authentication mechanisms are provided with this feature.

Authentication can also be disabled/enabled dynamically by using the Karaf webconsole, config command, or just setting the ?authEnabled? flag to false in the file etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg.

Hi Priyanka,


Have you tried Basic Authorization?  I noticed failures with our python scripts in recent builds, but adding Basic Authorization fixed this.

Can somebody suggest any way by which we can bypass authentication ?

After installing odl-restconf (with the error shared in the email thread), when I install my plugin, I am getting the following error. Because of the same I cant hit the basic neutron northbound URLs.. Can anyone suggest something on this?

Ah. Ok. Thanks ? I missed that error.

I do know that AAA authentication was turned on by default with the restconf feature Monday sometime so that is the change in behavior. I would have expected the way distros are built to pull in all of the AAA classes / bundles required so it does seem a little strange to see that error.

I think we need to refer to the AAA team and/or Ed Warnikie ? they may have a better answer as to what that error means.

Sorry I can?t be of more help.

I am not seeing any ?Error? per-sa below. I do see warnings about a response type not being resolvable to a concrete type ? is that what you are referring too? If so I believe those are benign. I also agree with the sentiment that we should clean up exceptions and warnings like these so that we do not confuse customers, developers or support folks looking at log files.

We won?t be having a AAA status meeting today due to the Summit earlier this week and some folks recuperating from traveling, etc..

It was great meeting some folks f2f for the first time for me, like Wojciech and Lakshman (just wish I had more time ?).  Also, from my experience, AAA is well-received by everyone from the community; so, congratulations and thank-you to everyone for all your hard work!  Looking forward to a better and more enterprise-ready AAA in Lithium!

We will be discussing our plans for Lithium next week this same time slot?  BTW, the slides for the AAA presentation is posted here and also cross-linked via AAA?s main Wiki page:

regarding persistency, there are actually two mechanisms in play: AuthN
data is persisted in an SQL Lite file (currently - this is subject to
change for Lithium).
AuthZ data is persisted as per the MD-SAL store persistency setup (ie if
that's not configured, then it doesn't persist).

Multitenancy is to an extent supported; we've defined domains pretty much
for that reason in AuthN. The AuthZ (draft) policy data model seeks to
cover for that, but currently the AuthZ service doesn't check for it.
Any additional deatil on the type of multi-tenancy use-case you have in
mind would be helpful.

Thanks,
Wojciech.

On our last ""status"" meeting, we talked about what to do for Lithium (sorry, I forgot to hit the ""record"" button again)...  A few ideas were floated around (including some mentioned at the Summit) in no particular order:


1.       Clustered AAA

a.       Clustered-aware persistency/caching

2.       AuthZ

a.       Toaster example with AuthZ

b.      XPath-like matching for resource URIs

c.       Multi-domain... How do we tie it in with GBP?  Or....?

3.       AuthN

Hi guys,

On our last ?status? meeting, we talked about what to do for Lithium (sorry, I forgot to hit the ?record? button again)?  A few ideas were floated around (including some mentioned at the Summit) in no particular order:


1.       Clustered AAA

a.       Clustered-aware persistency/caching

2.       AuthZ

a.       Toaster example with AuthZ

b.      XPath-like matching for resource URIs

c.       Multi-domain? How do we tie it in with GBP?  Or?.?
I kind of split the AuthZ ""leftovers"" into:
- Complete AuthZ for RPC, Notification and Mounted resources
- AuthZ resource path match engine. There are a couple of ideas here that we should discuss, of which xpath-like could be one.
- Authz for non Restconf access


3.       AuthN

a.       Openstack Keystone federation (SSO)
 b) DLUX UI for AuthN

4.       Karaf security

a.       JAAS login module for AAA

5.       Application Authorization

Wojciech,

Good question.  Looking at the code I think you are seeing the internal Grant resource but it's not directly surfaced through the REST model? Which raises a few questions.

As Liem points out a 'grant' is a 3-way association between a user, role and domain. This allows granting a user a role for a domain.

The AAA IDM REST model does *not* have a Grant resource instead it is based on the REST resources /domains/{domainId}/users/{userId}/roles where doing a POST creates a grant. See API docs https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYMmK_V5LMAjLGZOEjfKSX0x4Gwb-K5Xuk1wZskwWwY/edit#gid=0<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYMmK_V5LMAjLGZOEjfKSX0x4Gwb-K5Xuk1wZskwWwY/edit>

The thought did cross my mind to have an actual /grants REST resource but instead we stayed close to the Keystone way.

Peter.

Wojciech,

Good question.  Looking at the code I think you are seeing the internal Grant resource but it?s not directly surfaced through the REST model? Which raises a few questions.

As Liem points out a ?grant? is a 3-way association between a user, role and domain. This allows granting a user a role for a domain.

The AAA IDM REST model does *not* have a Grant resource instead it is based on the REST resources /domains/{domainId}/users/{userId}/roles where doing a POST creates a grant. See API docs https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYMmK_V5LMAjLGZOEjfKSX0x4Gwb-K5Xuk1wZskwWwY/edit#gid=0<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYMmK_V5LMAjLGZOEjfKSX0x4Gwb-K5Xuk1wZskwWwY/edit>

The thought did cross my mind to have an actual /grants REST resource but instead we stayed close to the Keystone way.

Peter.

Subject: Problems using Idmlight

Hi Guys,
ok, so I wanted to take a spin and do some operations using Idmlight.
I followed the Readme and also the Release note at: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/AAA:Helium_Release_Notes.
Still unable to get to the API... Is there something I'm missing?
I see IdmLight proper startup in the logs:

the AAA Authz component, and at least conceptually have been designing for.
It appears to be UC-3 in the Authz ""breakdown"" below. We're currently set
on delivering on UC-1 via the common AuthZ service. A few (unsolved) design
challenges, in the area of RPC broker, YANG augmentations and RPC routing,
remain to get to UC-2 and UC-3, at least with the design we've been
thinking of.. For those interested, read-on below...

[image: Inline images 1]

The challenge, as we currently see it, concerns of course
data-domain-knowledge and scalability of the AuthZ engine, i.e. it appears
to be an problematic to expect a common AuthZ service to have the insight
to determine data-level decisions. Generalizing from the use-case present
earlier on the thread, whether a N+1th instance of ""foo"" should be created
by anyone, or whether a value of M for attribute ""bar"" is allowed to be set
by user Baz, does require additional understanding of the data, with the
application owning/handling that data ultimately being the better place to
perform authorization, rather than a general AuthZ service engine.
For this purpose we're conceptually thinking of having apps augment the
basic AuthZ RPC model, which would allow a sort of ""chain of
responsibility"" to be installed, ie the general AuthZ service delivers
basic authorization (UC1), possibly also UC2, but data-specific
authorization policies, UC-3, would then result in an AuthZ RPC to the
owner-app just for the data-domain insight.
At least one challenge with this approach is that the AuthZ component
becomes an AuthZ RPC broker, of a kind, and possibly should have sole
rights to be an AuthZ RPC broker. An alternative would be to have apps,
register their specifically extended AuthZ RPC but delegate the basic AuthZ
evaluation to the AuthZ service.

Anyway, before we go on, would be interested in the views of the community
re the above, or any alternatives we should consider.

Regards,
Wojciech.

Bug2292 was fixed by this Gerrit:  https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/12433/  (Thanks, Harman!)  We will cherry-pick this into Helium.

For now, you can turn off Auth by editing the properties file:  org.opendaylight.aaa.authn.cfg under Karaf?s etc directory and changing the authEnabled value to false.  Note that you can also change the value via the ConfigAdmin on Karaf?s webconsole or cli.  No restart is needed.

together with Tomotej we've submitted a few patches that shows the
direction in terms of adding an MD-SAL cache for the TokenStore, and
effectively being a clustering enablement.

Patches are in:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/12674/ and
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/12494/3.

While this remains a work-in-progress, there is a topic that we'd like the
groups input one: The karaf feature definitions, esp in terms of defaults.

We have currently added an ""odl-aaa-authn-mdsal"" feature under karaf, which
is equivalent to the odl-aaa-auth feature bar the use of the md-sal as
token cache, in place of the current simple EHCache store.
The odl-aaa-auth feature is used by the odl-aaa-all, and both are currently
not suitable for an ODL cluster deployment.

Having odl-aaa-all start up both token stores and let OSGi pick (at random)
is rather undesirable.
Some better possibilities are:
1. Assume that clustered deployment is the norm, and replace the Ehcache TS
with the new one in odl-aaa-all, while putting the EhCache into a
odl-aaa-no-cluster feature bundle.
2. Assume that single deployment is the norm, and name the new feature as
odl-aaa-cluster, etc
3. Remove the odl-aaa-all feature all together and create a set of cluster
or no-cluster features that represent an explicit choice made by the user,
i.e. have tow feature bundles of odl-aaa-all-no-cluster and
odl-aaa-all-cluster
4. Remove all together the notion of an ""all"" feature bundle, ie have
composite bundles, where there is an odl-aaa-base, which needs to be
supplemented by odl-aaa-cluster/no-cluster-cache

Given that we'll be having a similar issue with the persistent data-store,
it would appear good timing to sort this out now.

Thoughts?

Regards,
Wojciech.

Thanks for working on this.  I think AAA should be cluster-ready out-of-box.  Ehcache also supports replication, but requires some configuring:  http://ehcache.org/documentation/2.6/replication

That said, there are some features I would like to see for token caching (currently supported by Ehcache out-of-the-box):

1) Token cache expiration purging
2) In-memory cache can grow large, needs to have a way to overflow to disk to avoid OOM

Hi,

Well yesterday, I started the whole procedure  from the beginning in a clean environment, and it works.
The ONLY thing that I actually changed is removed the installation of both ""odl-mdsal-all odl-restconf-all"".

So these are the steps I am doing now and its working:

1. Downloaded and extracted the Helium (from ODL official site)

2.  Installing the following features:
     feature:install odl-restconf odl-l2switch-switch odl-mdsal-apidocs odl-dlux-core
     feature:install odl-mdsal-clustering
     feature:install odl-openflowplugin-flow-services
     feature:install http
     bundle:install -s mvn:org.jolokia/jolokia-osgi/1.1.5

3. When working in single mode, the login succeeds immediately.
    When working in cluster of  3-nodes, login fails in the first 1-2 attempts but succeeds eventually.
    I assume that this is somehow related to the cluster configuration, maybe there is a constraint that ""login is disabled till all cluster modules/nodes are
    up and running"".

4. So, both Wiki pages (of the Dlux and cluster"" were correct in there instruction), and there was no need for the installation of ""odl-mdsal-all odl-restconf-all"".
    Note: I installed ""odl-mdsal-all odl-restconf-all"" following a recommendation I found in another opendaylight page due to ""jolokia"" failure (https://ask.opendaylight.org/question/872/install-cluster-karaf/).
              Yet, this is probably not relevant anymore, and I overcomed the jolokia failure.


THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HELP.

Aliza,

Do not install odl-restconf-all it brings in a feature called odl-mdsal-clustering-testapp which will force a 3 node cluster.

See https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2302

I recommend that you delete the data directory and reinstall the features and for restconf only install install odl-restconf.

Hello,

As long as the cluster feature is not enabled (feature:install odl-mdsal-clustering),  I am able to login controller.

Once clustering module is installed, login fails.  Login fails even if I run controller as a single node.

These are the features that are installed in each controller:

feature:install odl-openflowplugin-flow-services
feature:install http
bundle:install -s mvn:org.jolokia/jolokia-osgi/1.1.5


1. Should I connect differently when working with cluster? Are there missing features?

2. When cluster is enabled and there are 3 nodes in the cluster, should I be able to connect each controller GUI?  Or only ""member-1"" which is defined also the ""default"" one?

3. Should I'll be able to see ALL DB shards in all controllers through GUI?

Please advise.

Hi Wojciech,

Thanks for working on this.  I think AAA should be cluster-ready out-of-box.  Ehcache also supports replication, but requires some configuring:  http://ehcache.org/documentation/2.6/replication

That said, there are some features I would like to see for token caching (currently supported by Ehcache out-of-the-box):

1) Token cache expiration purging
2) In-memory cache can grow large, needs to have a way to overflow to disk to avoid OOM

Subject: AuthN MD-SAL TokenStore Cache

Hi All,
together with Tomotej we've submitted a few patches that shows the direction in terms of adding an MD-SAL cache for the TokenStore, and effectively being a clustering enablement.

Patches are in:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/12674/ and https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/12494/3.

While this remains a work-in-progress, there is a topic that we'd like the groups input one: The karaf feature definitions, esp in terms of defaults.
We have currently added an ""odl-aaa-authn-mdsal"" feature under karaf, which is equivalent to the odl-aaa-auth feature bar the use of the md-sal as token cache, in place of the current simple EHCache store.
The odl-aaa-auth feature is used by the odl-aaa-all, and both are currently not suitable for an ODL cluster deployment.
Having odl-aaa-all start up both token stores and let OSGi pick (at random) is rather undesirable.
Some better possibilities are:
1. Assume that clustered deployment is the norm, and replace the Ehcache TS with the new one in odl-aaa-all, while putting the EhCache into a odl-aaa-no-cluster feature bundle.
2. Assume that single deployment is the norm, and name the new feature as odl-aaa-cluster, etc
3. Remove the odl-aaa-all feature all together and create a set of cluster or no-cluster features that represent an explicit choice made by the user, i.e. have tow feature bundles of odl-aaa-all-no-cluster and odl-aaa-all-cluster
4. Remove all together the notion of an ""all"" feature bundle, ie have composite bundles, where there is an odl-aaa-base, which needs to be supplemented by odl-aaa-cluster/no-cluster-cache
Given that we'll be having a similar issue with the persistent data-store, it would appear good timing to sort this out now.
Thoughts?

Regards,
Wojciech.

I think AAA project should delete the configuration ""Choosing strategy: Gerrit Trigger"" in Source Code Management of the configuration of aaa-merge job on the Jenkins.
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/aaa/job/aaa-merge/configure

I think because the aaa-merge job has this configuration, build #55 did not use the latest code(Commit ID: 635149d13a554460a6bdbfa1063b06ae92b25344), but used old code (Commit ID: fcd1aa38da9b86fa2f48b713dbef0c0b5330a1fe).

Hi,

The latest features-aaa-xxxxxxx-features.xml file does not have ""odl-aaa-netconf-plugin"".
https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.snapshot/org/opendaylight/aaa/features-aaa/0.2.0-SNAPSHOT/features-aaa-0.2.0-20141114.202941-8-features.xml

Though old features-aaa-xxxxxxx-features.xml file has ""odl-aaa-netconf-plugin"" in it.

Therefore, it seems to me that the root cause of this issues is in AAA project.
I guess it is in the configuration of Jenkins of AAA project.

Feature odl-aaa-netconf-plugin was recently removed, which triggered controller verify to fails.

It turned out to be misconfiguration of AAA merge job, which instead of merged result, publishes patchset instead. The offending job was
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/aaa/job/aaa-merge/55/consoleFull

Which pushed back feature with old name.

AAA commiters, please fix that immediatelly, since it breaks projects depending on AAA.

We are developing the extension for ODL controller. For this extension we
need to implement token-based authentication (like on the attached
picture).

Could you clarify whether the AAA provide such functionality? It would be
perfect, if you give me a link for documentation which describes how I can
use this feature.

Thank you in advance.

I would like to nominate myself as PTL for AAA.

Responsibilities for a PTL include (from
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Lithium_Release_Pla
n):

* The Project Lead is expected to be responsible for the the project
meeting deadlines, interacting with other projects, and interacting with
the TSC
* The Project Lead will be subscribed to the release mailing list
<mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org> and must respond to requests send
to the a timely fashion?defined as 48 hours excluding weekends.
* If a Project Lead is not be able to do so, they should (i) have somebody
else stand in and do this on their behalf, (ii) send a mail to the release
mailing list <mailto:release at lists.opendaylight.org> indicating this and
the time period, and (iii) note the same information in the participating
projects section of the release plan.


In addition, as PTL of AAA, I would like to see AAA continue to bring
enterprise-grade security and compliance functionality to the ODL
controller and application ecosystem.  I am also an avid proponent of
FOSS.  I believe that with FOSS, we can bring forth the best of talents
from diverse companies and organizations to produce the best-of-breed
products that benefit us all in a fun, collaborative environment.  As PTL
of AAA, I would like to continue that trend and see AAA as the
best-of-breed, open and pluggable software for ODL, of course, with the
help of all our contributors and committers.



Thanks,

Two questions for the team -


 1.  Did we write any CODE which performs encryption? Or do we only call into third party libraries?
 2.  Do we have plans to write any custom encryption code? Or are we specifically using only third party libraries for that?

Thank you!

there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.

Very good question. I will let the experts answer but my understanding is protocol agnostic Network Services (Inventory, Topology, Statistics, FRM, Packet handlers, etc?) will be out of the controller project either in its own project (there is already a new project to build a multilevel topology) or in an existing one (as you mention we already talked about placing the Packet handlers in the l2switch project).

I am a bit worried about ""protocol-agnostic"" bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ""flow"", at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Bye,
Robert

there was already discussion about renaming those apps so we do not block some good general name (like NSF).
And yes - we might later come up with some more general modeling here which would be shareable by multiple protocols or at least apps. And then we would definitely play with the idea of pulling those models up to separate project so that controller models will stay protocol agnostic.

Now Abhijit got this idea regarding where is the best place to move OF-specific apps:
Those apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?

Hello Raghu,

I am a bit worried about ?protocol-agnostic? bit, as even if you factor the control protocol out, you have to make assumptions about your model of the world (contrast OF vs. PCEP vs. SR). Generic applications can work only as long as those assumptions hold.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline. Realistically, its functionality is tightly coupled with the lifecycle of the underlying protocol (we have fully-integrated equivalents in PCEP and NETCONF, and they work better). With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Bye,
Robert

Subject: Re: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Hi,

If there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.

Some of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.

However, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?

  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-manager
Another reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.

BTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more? This might be a good topic for the TWS Call as well.

Thoughts?

Thanks,

?Raghu

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

alluded to about my thought regarding the OF-specific apps: it is possible
for some one to use the OF-plugin but not use the L2 switch. So it should
not be mandatory for them to need to include the L2 switch. By OF-specific
apps (just so no one is confused) - Michal means what many people call NSFs:


   - statistics-manager
   - forwardingrules-manager
   - inventory-manager
   - topology-lldp-discovery
   - topology-manager

So I think these should be either in the controller, OF-plugin or a
separate new place (but not L2 switch).

I entered an enhancement requests in Bugzilla to capture an enhancement that could be used by the SNMP Plugin project.  My understanding of the process is enhancement requests should be entered in Bugzilla, and the project team should be informed via email.



Below is information about the enhancement request.  I would like to get feedback from the AAA team regarding whether this service should be owned by the AAA team.  We have already prototyped this service and would work closely with the AAA to complete development of the service.



Bugzilla # - 2576

Summary: Security Credential Service



Description: The SNMP Plugin project team will be developing a plugin that allows applications to interact with devices using the SNMP protocol.  Interacting with a device using SNMP requires a Security Credential.  This may be a simple community name for SNMPv1. SNMPv3 will require more sophisticated Security Credentials such as certificates.



A service is needed that allow an operator to populate a data store with security credentials needed to interact with devices.  The service must also allow applications (eg SNMP Plugin) to obtain security credentials from the data store so that it can interact with the device.  The Security Credential service should be able to provide security credentials for other protocols such as NETCONF.



This Enhancement Request is requesting the AAA team to provide this service.  The AAA team should work closely with the SNMP Plugin team to implement this service.



Thanks,

Steve

If you are on this list your project has yet to begin migrating to the
releng silo and Jenkins Job Builder (JJB).

At the time of this writing we now have 21 projects in the releng Jenkins
silo.  Overall, it will be very beneficial to all projects within
OpenDaylight to have every project under the releng Jenkins silo as
development and testing for Lithium ramp up.  For example, as it stands
right now, if your project has an integration job that is fired when an
upstream job is run, those jobs are no longer launching if your upstream
project has migrated to JJB (and many of the upstream projects such as
yangtools and controller already have).

There is a work-around short term if you really need those integration jobs
to fire before you migrate to the releng Jenkins silo, but the best long
term answer will be to just make the move as soon as your project is able.

The migration process is pretty straightforward and is documented here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/RelEng:Main#Builder

.. and as always, I'm very happy to help out if you have questions or get
stuck.

I see interesting conversation here on the services being separated from Openflow.
Thought my experience may add some value to this discussion.
I was new to ODL and checked stub, SNMP4SDN and OpenFlow plugins and wrote a new custom plugin for a circuit switch where I reused the following services -
?  forwardingrules-manager
?  inventory-manager
?  topology-manager
I could use topology and inventory manager very well. I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.
I could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.
I could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.
Basically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.
So, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.

It may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.
Also, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.

Just my thoughts.
Correct me if I am wrong in any of the above.

Thanks,
Aneesha

+1 to what Abhijit says above, but I'll add the caveat that if it ends up in the OF-plugin, it should be housed in such a way that it tries as best it can to avoid being any more OpenFlow-specific than it already is. Also, it should be amenable to other plugins providing the backing functionality.
For example, it should be possible and easy for somebody else to provide statistics and topology information to the relevant manager.

Those apps depend on ofplugin but it seems they do not depend on l2switch. Are there any dependencies of those apps pointing on l2switch services?

On the one hand, I agree that the FRM is currently very OF-oriented, the idea that some of what we were calling ""Network Service Functions"" end up getting migrated to being inside a specific plugin does feel wrong.

As long as the parts that can be kept OF-independent can still be consumed and reimplemented by others, I guess it's fine to move them from the controller to the OpenFlow plugin project, but it does feel off.

FRM is very much OF-specific, as it has the notion of a ?flow?, at least now. Given where we are on the Lithium trajectory, we can only do so much.

Inventory-manager is completely tied to OF, and the OFP design calls for its complete integration into the OFP pipeline.

With the intetion to deprecate opendaylight-inventory model, the roles of inventory-manager and topology-manager are largely the same (when we disregard the discovery piece, which again is technology-specific).

Hi,

If there was a discussion on this topic in the community I missed it. I know there is general consensus on moving the non-core parts of the controller from the controller repo to other projects as appropriate but I was hoping there would be a discussion on the specifics of the plan before we execute on it.

Some of these make complete sense to me. For example, All the Openflow related models and OpenFlow specific components like Statistics Manager, and LLDP Discovery certainly belong in the Openflow Plugin project.

However, I think the following  Applications need to be more generic and protocol agnostic although the we only had an Openflow implementation until now.   Or, Are we talking about splitting the functionality of these into Generic Components which implement the Models and the NB Interface and Openflow Specific implementations?

  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-manager
Another reason I am bringing it up here is that there was a discussion thread of making L2 Switch project to be the home for generic services like Topology and LLDP Discovery  and potentially renaming it to be more generic to reflect the true nature of its content.

BTW, Does the list below represent the complete  picture of migrations like this or is there more? This might be a good topic for the TWS Call as well.

Thoughts?

Subject: [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

Few questions wanted to confirm with you:

1. Are you planning to upstream your custom plugin for circuit switching to OpenDaylight?
      Our Plugin does not really cover all the features of the Circuit Switch Specification. It has the functionality which is required for our switch. Does this partial implementation really add value if we upstream (and also using AD-SAL)?
2. Are you using the MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (plugin & FRM) or are you using the AD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation (the OpenFlow 1.0 protocol plugin, FRM, etc.)?
        We decided to go with Hydrogen Release and AD-SAL as Helium was still not released. We used the ?Extensions to the OpenFlow Protocol in support of Circuit Switching? (Addendum to OpenFlow Protocol Specification (v1.0) ? Circuit Switch Addendum v0.3). We would like to move to MD-SAL based OpenFlow implementation but with the current priority work items, it may take some time to do this. We still have no time frame for that.
3. Can you elaborate the rough design that you are using the FRM? Will be great if you can share an architecture diagram.
       The design is same as the Openflow protocol. I am sharing the user guide to get an idea on how I am using the FRM.

Hi All,

I see interesting conversation here on the services being separated from Openflow.
Thought my experience may add some value to this discussion.
I was new to ODL and checked stub, SNMP4SDN and OpenFlow plugins and wrote a new custom plugin for a circuit switch where I reused the following services -
?  forwardingrules-manager
?  inventory-manager
?  topology-manager
I could use topology and inventory manager very well. I just used few parameters (which are relevant to our flows) for flows addition and deletion in forwardingrules-manager.
I could not use statistics manager service as the statistics are specific to packet switches and hence added a new REST API in this for circuit statistics.
I could not represent some properties for the nodeConnector but compromised them for an immediate solution.
Basically I tried reducing my work and hence reused the existing services.
So, I could make it work just by writing  a new southbound plugin without touching the services and the northbound.

It may be better to have the inventory and topology manager services available for any southbound plugin and not specific to openflow. Also, may be useful to make these more generic.
Also, Good to have the forwardingrules-manager services to be generic. So, one can add ACLs or Circuit connections or any other forwarding using this service.

Just my thoughts.
Correct me if I am wrong in any of the above.

Thanks,
Aneesha

Subject: Re: [controller-dev] [openflowplugin-dev] [L2switch-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

I agree that L2 switch is not a logical home for  generic network services as long as the project is called L2 Switch.  But,the name aside, That was exactly the proposed charter of the project.

""This proposal is to separate out the Layer 2 specific handling code into a separate project and also create several reusable services. Following are some of the generic services we intend to create.?

 At the end of the day it does not matter too much where the code belongs. With the right Karaf feature names and dependencies user will be able to find it.  It is just that, One would not think to look at Open Flow Plugin for generic network services.  For some of these services, I can understand the model being the only thing common/generic and each southbound plugin potentially supplying its own implementation. Still, I think there would be some services which are common, protocol independent network services and we need a good home for those.

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.



There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.



Thank you.

Michal

Subject: [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.


Thank you.

The ?RPC + AAA? might become the answer if it is the only answer, i.e.,
nobody fixes the bug.  Having RPCs is major hindrance and bring lots of

simple RESTconf URIs is infinitely easier to understand and manage.

It is targeted for Lithium. While it will be immediately useful for 
applications, we also need a configurable generic AAA component, as 
hand-coding these handlers for each application will be prone to errors. 
One very specific concern is that the commit cohorts must refrain from 
leaking state outside the datastore domain -- we have seen this in the 
Hydrogen release, where applications hooking onto this mechanism (which 
is very similar to DCL) brought the system down simply because they 
violated API contracts.

On Jan 12 I sent the following email about the need for a Security Credential Service.
https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/aaa-dev/2015-January/000244.html

I'm working on two projects, DIDM and SNMP Plugin.  These projects need to interact with a device using SNMP.  Interacting with a device requires security credentials (eg, password, community name, etc.).  The credential service should allow the operator to populate the service with security credentials, and allow applications to acquire the security credentials managed by the Credential Server.  For the first release, this service can be fairly simple and we have been working on a prototype.

My question to the AAA team is about ownership.  Who should own this type of service?  Is this something that should be owned by the AAA team?  Is the AAA team interested in working with the SNMP Plugin team on this?  Who should I be discussion this with on the AAA team?

I see generic credential management to be part of the AAA project?s scope.  See the model here<https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1D2yIkSn-ZOURZhL-_hikw0F7VBnWdknL-pONAScSyZk/edit>.  These credentials may be used for either NB, SB, or even sideways communication.  However, the release plan for AAA for Lithium currently does not include a credential manager service (due to resource constraints).  If this is something you can contribute to AAA, that would be greatly welcome!  And, of course, we can work with you on it to make sure it fits into the current AAA framework.

1)  It makes neutron use our aaa project authn, so we should (Liem will have to chime in to explain) get the ability to interface our neutron service with Keystone.

I was in some meetings with (among others) the PTL of Keystone, and this is NOT something the keystone folks want. Before you go down this path, I suggest talking to the keystone folks.

2)  Since there *wasn't* a neutron feature before you could load on its own, there is now a neutron feature, you can see how to use it in the patch for integration here:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/14524/

Since the previous way to pick up neutron was to pull in odl-nsf-all, you will need to change to using the old-neutron-northbound feature if you provide an existing provider.

Thoughts?

Anil,

This is indeed a great point. It would be nice to outline a Community Roadmap that would tackle the critical decisions such as:

#1 AD-SAL deprecation
#2 Java 8 requirement
#3 Neutron API changes

or any other long term decision. Moreover, I hope some projects will graduate to Core or another lifecycle.. Wouldn't it be a good idea to have perks/incentives that will make the projects want to graduate? Such as be listed in a different feature repository or be added as default to the distribution.?

Anyhow , I'll leave this discussion to the TSC.

Cheers

IMO, #2 is an ideal solution, but given that in community we think going forward AD-SAL will be deprecated so probably it make sense to defer to #1.

The only concern I see with #1 is that it will invite lot of questions like ""it was working with hydrogen/helium but not working with current master"" :) ( which i believe we can't avoid anyways) AND also updating the relevant documentation. If we can take care of documentation as well, I vote for #1.

Was there any discussion on when are we deprecating AD-SAL? AFAIK there were couple of discussions over mailing list but those never reached to any conclusion as such. IMHO having a time frame helps a lot to take decision about these kind of problems. e.g If we decide that AD-SAL deprecation will be announce in this release and it will be removed in beryllium, then IMO it probably make sense to defer the port change till next release.

Thanks

Hi Ed,

Indeed that has been problematic.  AD-SAL is using the Valves for security and is wielded from a user management perspective.However, I would like to see the community's opinion on the two options.

These options would be

#1 Leave everything as-is and simply move that to port 8282 to avoid confusion from people. Bringing AD-SAL would bring Tomcat. It also create a variety of 'Errors' in the logs as Jetty will also try to start the webapps and fail to do so because of the Tomcat-specific addons.

#2 Remove the Valves and Tomcat dependency and run AD-SAL alongside the current 8181 applications (on Jetty). This means that many northbound services will have to be revisited. While the task is not enormous it is more work than #1.. If people no longer use AD-SAL I'd vote for #1.. if there is a need for it I can look in #2.

Please let me know what you guys think!

Cheers
Mathieu

Guys,

     The old AD-SAL stuff is currently running a completely separate (and antiquated) Tomcat based stack on port 8080.  Unfortunately there are pieces of the AD-SAL that are quite thoroughly welded to Tomcat, and cannot easily be extracted from it.
     All of the newer stuff is using the karaf build in jetty web stack, which is currently running on port 8181.
     Port 8080 is traditionally the port used for web stuff in the java world.

     As the AD-SAL is being deprecated, I'd like to move the AD-SAL stuff to using port 8282, and have the karaf built in jetty running on port 8080 and 8181.  (please note I already have a patch out for making the neutron service run with jetty, on which every ports it is running, so this change should *not* impact the neutron service stuff).

     Before pushing patches to do this, I wanted to open up a discussion to see what other folks think about it.  So please see this less as a notification and more as a conversation starter ;)

Ed

I was asked to capture the events regarding an enhancement request I submitted to the AAA team.
The SNMP Plugin project is developing a plugin that allows application to interact with devices using SNMP.  Interacting with a device using SNMP requires a Security Credential.  On Jan 12 I filed an enhancement request in Bugzilla (#2576) and sent email to aaa-dev mailing list. https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/aaa-dev/2015-January/000244.html
The request was asking the AAA team to provide a Security Credential Service to manage credentials.
On Jan 22 a response email was sent by Liem Nyugen stating that generic credential management is part of AAA's scope, but the release plan for Lithium does not include it due to resource constraints.  Liem stated the AAA team would welcome a contribution from the SNMP Plugin team, and that the AAA team would work with the SNMP Plugin team regarding a contribution from the SNMP team.

Going forward the SNMP Plugin team will work on the Security Credential Service and continue to work with the AAA team.



Thanks,

Steve

Subject: [OpenDaylight TSC] New AAA PTL!

Hi folks,

We have voted in a new PTL for AAA:  Wojciech Dec from Cisco!

Congrats, Wojciech!  It's well-deserved...  In case you don't know, Wojciech has been with us (AAA) since the project's inception and has been in-charge of all the authorization magic in the project.

Cheers,
Liem

PS:  I will be working with Wojciech to ensure a smooth transition...

on last weeks call the question of ""how do we go about validating library
licenses"" came up in the context of the Rest client discussion

The short answer is that, in general an Apache Commons, will be fine and
there is a background scan process in place to pick up any ""imports"".
The longer answer is that if anyone has particular concerns or wants a
proactive review, then please contact *probb at linuxfoundation.org

3.0.3... so far everything works fine with one exception:

feature odl-aaa-authn depends on:

<bundle>wrap:mvn:org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.7.2</bundle>

and it no longer wraps correctly.  I suspect this is because of the JNI
hacks it uses
to be able to run sqllite (which is not java based), but do not actually
know yet (still poking).

What would it take to replace sqllite with something a little more
mainstream in the java world (like Apache Derby)?

Ed

P.S.  I am not having any other issues with 'wrapped' bundles other than
this so far, but with
this *one* bundle I am getting this exception:

it appears that the 3.8.7 sqlite wrap library is not compatible with Java
8. May I ask you if you're planning on providing an updated version any
time soon?

Subject: [Aaa-dev] Issues with sqllite and karaf 3.0.3 (and thus blocking
Java 8)
To: ""aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org"" <aaa-dev at lists.opendaylight.org>, ""
discuss at lists.opendaylight.org"" <discuss at lists.opendaylight.org>


I am in the process of trying to get us in position to migrate to karaf
3.0.3... so far everything works fine with one exception:

feature odl-aaa-authn depends on:

<bundle>wrap:mvn:org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.7.2</bundle>

and it no longer wraps correctly.  I suspect this is because of the JNI
hacks it uses
to be able to run sqllite (which is not java based), but do not actually
know yet (still poking).

What would it take to replace sqllite with something a little more
mainstream in the java world (like Apache Derby)?

Ed

P.S.  I am not having any other issues with 'wrapped' bundles other than
this so far, but with
this *one* bundle I am getting this exception:

opendaylight-user*@*root>bundle:install -s
wrap:mvn:org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.8.7

given the rotation of ocus areas as well as people on the AAA Project,
we've come to a situation where only a few of the original project's
committers and contributors are still actively participating. As such we
would like to call for new committer candidates.
If interested please do a reply to all to express your interest and
optionally provide an brief summary of:
- Your coding experience, esp in Java
- Examples, if any, of you contributions to the ODL project (esp AAA) or
other open-source projects

While the above info is optional, I'm sure it will likely help folks in
getting to know you and evaluating your candidature, especially if you're
new to the project

Your replies will go in for a short list out of which, following the
project's procedures, a set of committers will be chosen by the current
committers and the ODL TSC.

If interested, please reply by Wed, Feb 25.

Thanks,
Wojciech.

The persistence project will no longer use SQLite and we will consider as high priority to align with the controller working out of the box.

I have a question about working out of the box. The user will have to install the persistence feature, so if the persistence project automatically setup MySQL for example, would that be OK to consider out of the box?

Hi Krell,
The persistence project should come with @ least one data store that works out of the box without any installation... Right now it is SQLite, i think Ed's comment is to replace it with something like Apache Derby or HSQLDB, e.g. works out of the box with no installation + an option to change to mqsql & etc...

Hi Ed,

There is a AAA project deliverable for Lithium to stop using sqlite and switch to using the persistence project's database solution.

sqlite also has quite limited portability... and since we have folks trying to run ODL on all kinds of platforms... having that lack of portability at the heart of ODL is probably also not a good idea...

We will look into the suggested databases (Derby, HSQLDB) to make sure we align with the out of the box property. By default we would use one of those, and we will integrate with the configuration subsystem to allow the user to switch to MySQL for example in case they need to.

I would be interested in being a committer. I have over 20 years of software programming experience ranging from small embedded devices to distributed systems. While I have experience with several programming languages (c, c#, python, ?), I have used Java the majority of my career. Beginning in college, I became interested in security and have had the fortune to continue to develop my skillset in this space over my career, working on standard protocols like SSL/TLS, IPsec, and RADIUS.  I also have experience with performing security reviews from both an architecture and code perspective. I spent some time working on OpenStack Neutron; this work primarily involved integrating upstream changes with vendor proprietary extensions. I am currently working on adding tests to the AAA project.

Subject: Call for AAA committer candidates.

Hi All,
given the rotation of ocus areas as well as people on the AAA Project, we've come to a situation where only a few of the original project's committers and contributors are still actively participating. As such we would like to call for new committer candidates.
If interested please do a reply to all to express your interest and optionally provide an brief summary of:
- Your coding experience, esp in Java
- Examples, if any, of you contributions to the ODL project (esp AAA) or other open-source projects
While the above info is optional, I'm sure it will likely help folks in getting to know you and evaluating your candidature, especially if you're new to the project

Your replies will go in for a short list out of which, following the project's procedures, a set of committers will be chosen by the current committers and the ODL TSC.
If interested, please reply by Wed, Feb 25.
Thanks,
Wojciech.

Greetings,
here is the update of goals and deadlines:

With Amit from l2switch we came to agreement that all NSF apps will be moved to openflowplugin. And we might later change mind and move it elsewhere but for now in order not to increase current delay we want proceed.

Here are shifted deadlines for migration steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 23.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 30.01.2015)

Subject: [openflowplugin-dev] migration of openflow related modules and applications from controller into ofplugin repo

Greetings,
there are already some activities going on which are aimed to migrate openflow related models and applications from controller to openflowplugin repository.

Migration will take following steps:

  *   copy corresponding projects from controller into openflowplugin
  *   change project and package names where necessary (without changing model content) (deadline: 09.01.2015)
  *   adapt downstream project in order to use those model projects (deadline: 16.01.2015)
  *   remove models from controller repository (deadline: 23.01.2015)

Models to migrate:

  *   model/model-flow-base
  *   model/model-flow-service
  *   model/model-flow-statistics

Apps to migrate

  *   statistics-manager
  *   forwardingrules-manager
  *   inventory-manager
  *   topology-lldp-discovery
  *   topology-manager

Donwstream projects (so far)

  *   aaa
  *   l2switch
  *   ovsdb
  *   openflowplugin
  *   affinity
  *   packetcable
  *   grupbasedpolicy

If you have questions, contributions, comments then please feel free to respond.

The reason for models to move into openflowplugin is that those models are openflow specific and mostly driven by openflowplugin development. And controller project plans to go more abstract/general way.

With applications the situation is similar with one difference - there is no direct downstream project, there are just projects depending on dataStore result of those applications.


There are no deadlines for applications yet but moving them together with models might spare us some renaming work.


Thank you.

Regards,

Michal

I've pushed out an initial change to address your request for more negative testing (null, empty string, etc.) at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/15688. This change was supposed to be targeted at only ClaimBuilder. However, since AuthenticationBuilder extends it, I had to make changes there as well. Unfortunately, there was no validation for these types of failures in place in the builders. So I ended up touching quite a few files already, and I'm not done yet. After speaking with Liem, there were a few issues that needed to be addressed:
1) missing validation (I've tried to update the interface documentation to capture at a minimum the required fields).
2) the MutableClaim and MutableAuthentication are actually supposed to be Immutable 

Also, in chatting with some folks here it sounds like these builders would actually go away, if we end up moving the authentication piece into MD-SAL, since they would be generated by the yang tools. 

So my question is with respect to the current commit I've posted. Is it the right direction to take? If we are going to move authn into MD-SAL, maybe we just skip hardening the builders for now?

I do not why we keep on showing not active projects in the ODL project list wiki [1], if we cannot remove them at least a note saying ""not active or not available this release"".

I thought that this was being handled by having in the integration cfg the
jobs it depended on so it could run integration jobs like every other
project does (see example of controller).

I would think that would be the correct way, rather than putting new jobs
in other projects... one place vs 43 places...

Hi everybody,

I think it is CRITICAL for all projects to run the feature-test. As Ed mentions all downstream projects and specially the integration with the ?official? karaf distribution will fail if there are wiring errors non being caught by the feature-test.

It appears for reasons I have not yet tracked down fully that projects which get their features-tests from yangtools... are no longer running it as part of their build (note: not saying you guys disabled it... its just not running).

What I have tracked down is how to fix it.. just switch to running the one from odlaprent.

Examples for controller and OFplugin are here:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:features-test

Please fix your projects ASAP... as without the SingleFeatures test all kinds of wiring errors
can creep in, while with it, your verify and merge jobs protect not only you, but all of
your downstream consumers :)

As your TWS talk is nearing, I would like to present my views.

I think ${project}-integration job does basically the same thing
as ${project}-merge, only the triggers (and notifications) are different.
Build from source in ${project} git, run unit tests, upload artifacts.
*-merge is triggered by gerrit; *-integration should be triggered
by ${dependency}-merge and ${dependency}-integration jobs.
Maybe we should merge them to a single ${project}-publish job if possible.

1) a controller committer merges a patch
2) controller-merge-master publishes artifacts
3a) controller-distribution triggers
3b) openflowjava-integration-master triggers

Now we have two jobs running (3a, 3b) and based on the layout of job 
queue, slave spinup, etc. etc., three things can happen:
- 3a may pick up artifacts from 3b, or
- 3a picks up artifacts before 3b, or
- 3a picks up some artifacts before 3b and some after that

The same thing is going to happen if I quickly merge a bunch of patches...

what artifacts will get into that distribution, since if that image will 
undergo CSIT to see whether a controller change did not break OF, that 
OF piece needs to be self-consistent.

Jenkins are just like threads, with Nexus being memory. What I am asking 
is: what are the locks the reader (controller-distribution job) holds to 
prevent writers (all the merge and integration jobs) from modifying 
state (artifacts in Nexus) as it is being read to assemble the distribution?

If we have no such assurances, what assurance do we have in the 
reliability and repeatability departments? When things break, how do we 
track which source code corresponds to that particular controller-build?

Hi Sherry,
well, at least for Lithium, we won't be moving the user-store to MD-SAL. I'd say let's harden at least a bit the stuff we have now, as currently it appears to cause surprises to users that really we should be catching in tests.
Cheers,

This change was supposed to be targeted at only ClaimBuilder. However, since AuthenticationBuilder extends it, I had to make changes there as well. Unfortunately, there was no validation for these types of failures in place in the builders. So I ended up touching quite a few files already, and I'm not done yet. After speaking with Liem, there were a few issues that needed to be addressed:
1) missing validation (I've tried to update the interface documentation to capture at a minimum the required fields).
2) the MutableClaim and MutableAuthentication are actually supposed to be Immutable

Also, in chatting with some folks here it sounds like these builders would actually go away, if we end up moving the authentication piece into MD-SAL, since they would be generated by the yang tools.

So my question is with respect to the current commit I've posted. Is it the right direction to take? If we are going to move authn into MD-SAL, maybe we just skip hardening the builders for now?

Following up on this. So the problem appears to be an internal race condition inside of MD-SAL / AAA / config system combined with logic flaws about retrying connections.

Basically, the way I get this to reproduce is Iist all of the features that I want to install in the featuresBoot list and then start a clean controller (I.e. delete data directory, delete /etc/opendaylight). When the controller starts up there is a race condition from the config subsystem injecting the self-referencing netconf connection and the AAA database being locked. When the problem occurs the AAA database file is locked and thus when netconf tries to connect and specifically authenticate the AAA fails because of an exception. Then because the config subsystem, or more specifically the netconf mounter is a try once and done (no retries) it fails to connect the self-referencing controller.

Potential fixes from what I can tell:


 1.  enhance AAA logic to handle issues when the database might be locked, and consider a wait retry mechanism (we would need to answer the question of ?when would we expect this error? to implement something like this).
 2.  and/or enhance the netconf mounting logic to retry even if it got a failed authentication (though that seems a little strange)

I think ultimately #1 is the longer term fix. If you are trying to reproduce this note that I see this every once in a while - on 10 machines, I see it consistently on 1 of them every time I run a suite of tests.

For now I have worked around this by installing the features more slowly / independently, but this is clearly not an ideal solution. I?ll see if I can?t come up with a more consistent reproduction scenario but figured I would share what I know in the mean time.

Pone other comment - in the AAA code it would be really helpful it the entire exception was printed to the log, not just the message. In general the AAA code catches exceptions and logs the e.getMessage() or they use an overloaded toString on the exception to only print a simple message. It is better practice to print the stack trace too though to make it easier to debug :)   log.info( ?Caught exception ? + e.getMessage(), e ) <? passing the exception as a second argument will print the stack trace to the log for the exception and may provide additional information.

Thank you,

Devin

Subject: [Aaa-dev] Cannot connect to database server Exception - Sporadic Error

Hello AAA Devs -

I am seeing a sporadic error in my karaf log files stating that the database file is locked. This results in an authentication failure which unfortunetly prevents the controller from mounting itself as a netconf controller. Any hints or pointers that I could look at to try and understand what might be happening in these cases?

Hi Folks,

Following up on this. So the problem appears to be an internal race condition inside of MD-SAL / AAA / config system combined with logic flaws about retrying connections.

Basically, the way I get this to reproduce is Iist all of the features that I want to install in the featuresBoot list and then start a clean controller (I.e. delete data directory, delete /etc/opendaylight). When the controller starts up there is a race condition from the config subsystem injecting the self-referencing netconf connection and the AAA database being locked. When the problem occurs the AAA database file is locked and thus when netconf tries to connect and specifically authenticate the AAA fails because of an exception. Then because the config subsystem, or more specifically the netconf mounter is a try once and done (no retries) it fails to connect the self-referencing controller.

Potential fixes from what I can tell:


 1.  enhance AAA logic to handle issues when the database might be locked, and consider a wait retry mechanism (we would need to answer the question of ?when would we expect this error? to implement something like this).
 2.  and/or enhance the netconf mounting logic to retry even if it got a failed authentication (though that seems a little strange)

I think ultimately #1 is the longer term fix. If you are trying to reproduce this note that I see this every once in a while - on 10 machines, I see it consistently on 1 of them every time I run a suite of tests.

For now I have worked around this by installing the features more slowly / independently, but this is clearly not an ideal solution. I?ll see if I can?t come up with a more consistent reproduction scenario but figured I would share what I know in the mean time.

Pone other comment - in the AAA code it would be really helpful it the entire exception was printed to the log, not just the message. In general the AAA code catches exceptions and logs the e.getMessage() or they use an overloaded toString on the exception to only print a simple message. It is better practice to print the stack trace too though to make it easier to debug :)   log.info<http://log.info>( ?Caught exception ? + e.getMessage(), e ) <? passing the exception as a second argument will print the stack trace to the log for the exception and may provide additional information.

Thank you,

Hi,

 I must admit I didn't see this particular problem so far. It obviously looks like something thrown up by SQLite on reading/writing. We're going to replace SQLite with another db backend so hopefully that may redress that, in the meantime if you have more info on how to reproduce this please let us know.

Cheers,
Wojciech.

Subject: [Aaa-dev] Cannot connect to database server Exception - Sporadic Error

Hello AAA Devs -

I am seeing a sporadic error in my karaf log files stating that the database file is locked. This results in an authentication failure which unfortunetly prevents the controller from mounting itself as a netconf controller. Any hints or pointers that I could look at to try and understand what might be happening in these cases?

If I understand correctly,  we are moving away from CompositeNode to NormalizedNode which causes broken restconf.
We have some project ongoing using restconf between webUI and controller. I wonder when we can expect this to be fixed.
We kind of blocked by this issue.

it appears like the US daylight savings time change, which didn't quite
happen in Europe yet, has resulted in this call being set at 10am PST/1800
CET (which is when I kicked it off, but seemingly am the only one in the
room).

Given that we really need to chat regarding the Lithium plan, and meet the
new folks, I'll set-up a call for tomorrow, unless folks want to jump on
the bridge now. BTW I'm also on #opendaylight-aaa IRC room.

Subject: [controller-dev] My DevStack integration borked .. AAA errors in log.

I tried to run my OpenStack GBP to OpenDaylight GBP integration last night.

DevStack throws ""500 server errors?. This was working absolutely fine 9 days ago, (snapshot) and probably since then too (can?t recall last time I ran it, but pretty sure since 9 days ago, so can?t give you an exact date it worked last, but I know it was broken last night and still is).

I saw LOADS of AAA messages in the log:
https://gist.github.com/0e5c98856f0ede55e134

A simple POC using basic Auth works.

Feature loaded is: odl-restconf

Effectively this is blocking me. Anyone have any clues as to what is going on?

So we're stuck at the moment with the Helium SR3 version bump patches. With aaa's final version bump patch failing to build [1]. The error is that it's not able to find features-netconf 0.2.8-Helium-SR3. Since this is the 0.0.1 version bump. I think it should be looking for 0.2.9-SNAPSHOT and not a release number.

So now I'm worried, did we introduce a new cycle somewhere?


Adding this explicitly to the features-authz dependencies just makes it fail on more Helium-SR3 artifacts. I feel this is wrong, something must be pulling in Helium-SR3 artifacts when it should be pulling in SNAPSHOT artifacts at this point.

The Gerrit patch we're stuck on is this one [2].

Any ideas?

given that the MD-SAL is a simple data store, in the implementation of the
MD-SAL based Token Cache, we're looking at making some tradeoff's with the
challenge being the removal of expired tokens in a relatively timely manner.
Two approaches described below accomplish that but feature a tradeoff in
performance  ie We would like to collect feedback on these (or suggestions
for a alternative approaches):

1. On each cache API access (eg a new token add or validation), run a sweep
of all tokens in the store, cleansing out any expired ones.
Pro: Cache, when used, is thoroughly cleansed. Simple data structure
Con: Performance at scale, ie with 100k tokens we'd be reading running
blindly through the whole list each time.

2. Run a per user token sweep on API access, cleansing out any expired one.
Pro: Sweeper runs bound by the number of tokens in the accessing user's
store vs total token number in the system, ie More reasonable performance
at scale (Assuming a reasonable token/user distribution)
Con: Requires an additional data structure. Stale tokens for users who
don't access will continue to be visible until they access again.

In both approaches, stale tokens could appear in any restconf call on the
data-store, but throughout only valid tokens would be honored, ie
attempting to access with a stale token will be rejected, even if the
data-store still has that stale token.
We could redress this ""display"" issue only by having a scheduled cache
sweeper run, vs API access triggered runs. This could be option 3, however
we think it doesn't really buy much (there is still a good chance of a
restconf access in between cleaner runs), and for the rest having the
characteristics of 1 above.

Feedback's welcome.

Regards,
Wojciech.

Today I won?t be able to make it at this time. Only slot I could make it is 9am PST?

That said, the proposal pretty much describes it all, i.e. Keeping the existing (implicit) API, slide in H2 instead of SqLite. Some considerations that come to apply are:

  *   Patch https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/15484/
  *   Encryption (should we use the inbuilt one, or have the writer /reader code do encryption?)

Yes, it was said to be a high prio activity, so we can see it as fair game. I?d think that it shouldn?t take more than a few days to do and test.

I will start working on this. I saw the patch that exists.  From the notes on Gerritt, is seems that it is not fully working but it is a solid start. Will also consider the encryption consideration you bring up.

c.      See the end of email  for the commit steps and the output of the git review -f Error

Plan for hackfest.
     We plan on being at the hackfest.  Our main focus there will be to work on creating unit and integration tests for the IDMLight components.

Any help on getting code checked in would be greatly appreciated.

here if any needed to happen.

Basically, a few TSC meetings ago when the AAA project was talking about
how to get out of their current bind, the topic of Keystone federation came
up. I think Ed then mentioned that he'd heard people on the OpenStack side
saying to be very careful about how you go about doing keystone federation
because there were pitfalls that would be very dangerous.

So, I think that leaves us with a few questions:
1.) Is this all moot for now since we're likely not going to deliver any
Keystone federation in the near future?
2.) Do we have design documents for AAA federation?
3.) If so, are there people we should be reviewing them with?

Cheers,

My understanding (and I'm willing to be educated otherwise) of Keystone
Federation is that it
supports things like keystone-to-keystone federation or keystone consuming
identity properties
issued by an external identity provider.  I don't remember seeing anything
about Keystone providing
the identity properties and my experience with repeated querying Keystone
for identity information is
that it doesn't perform well.

Keystone federation indeed is a moot point at this stage. That said, the federation design is actually covered by our original AAA blueprint (via the Pluggable Authenticators): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2IWJPwtf67LeDd5a0JrZkpNaHc/edit?usp=sharing
 We currently already support limited federation by means of SSSD, or rather whatever* SSSD supports and is plugged into should work (*whatever not having been tested though).

Regards,
Wojciech.

Subject: Re: AAA keystone federation


This is somewhat more of a meta comment...:

My understanding (and I'm willing to be educated otherwise) of Keystone Federation is that it
supports things like keystone-to-keystone federation or keystone consuming identity properties
issued by an external identity provider.  I don't remember seeing anything about Keystone providing
the identity properties and my experience with repeated querying Keystone for identity information is
that it doesn't perform well.

Carmen and Kailash have updated the aaa test plan, primarily in the IdmLight section.   Kailash has tested most of the IdmLight Rest endpoints successfully with the H2 DD.  He also ran the existing robot integration tests that tested token endpoints ""/oauth2"".   Carmen is working on adding the IdmLight tests to the automated test environment via robot. The Integration tests are already present in the test environment.

Wojciech,  I have attached the test plan that they are basing their IdmLight test work off of.  You can manually test locally by running the curl commands in the IdmLight sections.  To run the existing integration tests you would need to have  robot environment set up.


Thanks
Eduardo

Here is the root cause to the builds failing yesterday. Apparently ODL-Parent was not merged in time when the patch to update the Karaf version in the ODL-Controller repo was merged. Build should start passing again as ODL-Parent it merged now.

Do check your incoming patch queues, as Tony pushed some patches to fix
projects which had locally
pegged themselves to karaf 3.0.1.  Also, if you are using gogoshell, we
have reports of some issues there.

However, I think most folks should be good now :)

with the MD-SAL (Cluster capable) token store nearly there,
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/18418/ , I'd like to get some
feedback on how to proceed in terms of enabling it in the project vs the
current default (non cluster capable) token store.

In the patch above the MD-SAL token store is bundled under a newly defined
feature called odl-aaa-authn-cluster. With this approach in effect all the
aaa features should/would have the *-cluster  feature name.
This is something that most users of the system won't have a clue about
which has me concerned especially since various components, eg restconf,
netconf include odl-aaa-authn, which loads up the current non-cluster
capable default version(s) of aaa features.

Some choices are:
1. Change the default to be cluster capable, i.e. Keep the existing AAA
feature naming, but replace the non-cluster-capable bundles therein with
new ones as they come to be (eg the md-sal token cache), effectively
becoming the new default. This isolates the feature changes to AAA, and is
IMO the cleanest. The legacy bundles would get a no-cluster (or the like
name).
2. Change all dependent features to use a new aaa *-cluster feature set.

Welcome your feedback.

Thanks,
-Wojciech

I have a first cut (submitting tomorrow, read 1 below) of making the H2 Database properties configurable via Karaf's ManagedService feature.  I had a few questions


1)      Comment: I will push the code for review tomorrow. I got into a git issue (dangling commit) which I will fix and then push code tomorrow.

2)      Please advise if implemented configuration of properties in the correct/best practice way in ODL.

3)      I have been unable to test as some of the feature names are changed.  Currently I get that  odl-aaa-all  is missing when I tried to start it.  Usually I start the following features.  odl-aaa-all odl-restconf odl-aaa-authz-all.  I know some of the features names changed. Which should I use.

Thanks
Eduardo

it's in: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/18418/10/README.md

Note: I've previously seen other documentation for AAA, but I don't have

I have submitted the initial attempt at H2 configuration.

Unfortunately I have been unable to test out locally as the ""features"" that I used to test before don't seem to be present.

Before I was able to test by deploying the following features (I actually put them in the feature boot config file org.apache.karaf.features.cfg)
      featuresBoot=config,standard,region,package,kar,ssh,management,odl-l2switch-switch-ui,odl-dlux-all,odl-aaa-authz-all,odl-restconf


Can you give some guidance on current state of testing aaa.   I have tried different iterations of deploying features to no success.

the integration project?  That?s how I know to do it, so that it will pull all the latest artifacts from

My m2 repository got in some bad state I guess.  I completely removed repository, did pull, ran mvn clean install and started karaf. All working now.

I also only had to load the
    ?odl-dlux-all? feature, and that pulled in the aaa features needed, including the IdmLight

Looking at commit in question and failed tests, That patch does not seems to be reason - it changed code only for PUT / POST path (all PUT / POST tests are succeding)

And failed tests are GET for statistics, which seems to be timing issue or something new in OF plugin.

24 new failures are coming now [1].  I'm not totally sure how to drill down to find the potential patch that introduced it, but this is my guess [2].

I'll see if I can triage the failures more specifically, but I know some failures are because there are no connector-statistics seen in the output from restconf.

another failure was with trouble in interacting with the operational store via restconf where the response indicated the data model content did not exist.

OK, it seems the stats issue is resolved through this patch:

Hi Tony, I am not sure that is the issue, the right karaf log (*) to look at is:

And this does not show the exception but it does not either show anything indicating why openflow stats do not work :(

(*) if you just press on the karaf.log at the job front page it will take the last not failed test, I was confused too for a while :)

Looking at commit in question and failed tests, That patch does not seems to be reason - it changed code only for PUT / POST path (all PUT / POST tests are succeding)

And failed tests are GET for statistics, which seems to be timing issue or something new in OF plugin.

I have spent a few days trying to set up federated AAA using SSSO and
FreeIPA, but have hit some road blocks using
https://jdennis.fedorapeople.org/doc/sssd_configuration.pdf.  I was
wondering if anyone has successfully set up federated AAA with the Lithium
codebase?  If so, I would like to ask a few questions:

1) Which features did you install and in which order?
2) Were you able to successfully login to AAA DLUX using federated
credentials?  If so, which URL did you use to connect?  I have strange
behavior where I am able to access DLUX through ports 8181 and 8383 (8383
is the port I specified in etc/org.opendaylight.aaa.federation.cfg as
secureProxyPorts).
3) In /etc/httpd/conf.d/my_app.conf I specify ""ProxyPass /
http://localhost:8383/"", which causes 401 errors when I try to connect to
FreeIPA web console.  If I change to ""ProxyPass /*aaa*
http://localhost:8383/"", then it appears the two work side by side.  Do you
have any suggestions as to which location I should specify?

Ideally, I would like to get this solved quickly to ensure there are no
code gaps that need to be fulfilled before M5 and code freeze.  Please let
me know if you have successfully setup federated AAA.  I greatly appreciate
any help :).

Thanks,

Ryan Goulding

The lispflowmapping project recently bumped versions on master, and the
version bump patch had no issues.  However, we now have an issue in
SingleFeatureTest: when a feature with transitive dependency on
features-aaa is loaded an exception is thrown:

Error resolving
artifactorg.opendaylight.aaa:features-aaa:xml:features:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT:Could
not find artifact
org.opendaylight.aaa:features-aaa:xml:features:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT in
defaultlocal (file:/tmp/r/)

I checked that AAA did correctly bump versions, and the merge succeeded.
 I tried a ""recheck"" several times.  One thing that seemed a bit off was
the artifact type, the exceptions shows that the test is looking for an
XML type artifact and I see that the AAA feature artifacts are declared
as JAR, but that's not something changed recently, so I assume it should
still work.

Anyone has any insight?

This is the Gerrit with the issue:

Due to some last minute appointments I won?t be able to attend the call today. Bridge should be still up in case anyone wants to chat and/or folks can catch me on IRC or mail.
That said, I?d like to list out a few things that require team attention:


  1.  SSSD Configuration w/IdP

We need to revisit the setup and working of this mechanism. So far, a few folks, myself included, haven?t been quite able to get it working using the existing documentation.
I filed https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3322

2. SQL Injection
I see that the patch is there. However, could we have the robot tests run against it. In addition I have one comment that I?ll post.

3. Project Backlog for Berylium
Let?s please start putting proposals in. Currently we have (top level):

  *   AAA MD-SAL data store
  *   Completion of Authz
  *   General Keystore (SNMP, Netconf)
  *   Keystone (although validity of this approach has been put in doubt)

Wojciech.

it took a while but I found the issue. It seems that someone removed the
connector for IdmLight in the controller project, but given that it doesn't
actually need to live on a separate port I moved it to the 8181 one.
Proposed fix is in:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/21891

curl -X GET -v -H ""Content-type:application/json""
http://127.0.0.1:8181/auth/v1/users

Will get you started.

I have another fix for the authentication of the API end point, but the
above will get you started.

Cheers,
Wojciech.

As a side note, I have SSSD setup and configured for a private web app
working.  I also have an apache configuration to forward SSSD to ODL and
seeing some of the appropriate headers forwarded to TokenAuthFilter.java
(of course SSSD w/ Kerberos is a ClaimAuth, but this at least proves the
headers make it to karaf).  However, I am still unable to hit the
federation endpoint (via POST) successfully... I get a 404.

Also, I discovered SssdFilter.java is never called (except for init()...
that is working);  I put breakpoints on all methods and performed requests
to /oauth2/federation.  Would this same issue have affected the
/oauth2/federation endpoint and corresponding filters?  I can't seem to hit
any of the federation endpoints defined by
aaa-authn-sts/src/main/resources/WEB-INF/web.xml servlet.


Thanks very much!!

The AAA API is already there, it's called Idmlight and allows basic crud on the user db. I'll forward some documents separately, or you can google for them from the previous odl summit.

Hi Lnt,



The AAA API is already there, it's called Idmlight and allows basic crud on the user db. I'll forward some documents separately, or you can google for them from the previous odl summit.



Alex i understand has been looking into the dlux integration of this Api.

the basic token-based access works as follows:
- Request a token using credentials from the API at /oauth2/token
- Embed the token in an Oauth2 header when accessing any API

Now, the above isn't really suitable for GUI access, unless you have a
federated form of it, which is what the SSSD module adds. In other words:
- Use browser to authenticate with a federated IdP (eg facebook).
- Use the provided ""token"" to access ODL

Wojciech.

pushed this patch, and realized there is a race for when
IdmLightApplication() constructor is called.  This is currently breaking
master, as authenticated rest calls fail.

I looked a little closer, and I think there may have been trouble with AAA in this run.
what I tried to say before is that I don?t think this is anything VTN specific, and it?s
surely not easily reproducible.

the big picture issue is that our CI job determined that the controller was not UP,
because polling on restconf/modules never gave a 200 back in 10 minutes.


I found this ERROR in the karaf.log, after looking closer.  Wondering if it?s something
known by the aaa team?

The default credentials that AAA provides is admin/admin for basic Auth. DLUX use them to authenticate and keep them in user session for subsequent requests.

I think there was a component added in AAA to keep all the authenticated tokens in md-sal datastore. That way it can be tracked, which user is logged and till what time that token is valid. We might want to use something similar in DLUX for authentication.

DLUX will also need to utilize user management of AAA to fully utilize this.

It appears the code may be broken for this case, so thank you for opening
the bug.  You are supposed to be able to change this sort of thing using
this process:


Issue a PUT request to the correct user id with the new payload.  For
example, to change user admin with starting password admin to
password=newpassword:
*curl -X PUT -u admin:admin -H ""Content-type: application/json""
--data-binary @user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/1
<http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/1>*
{""userid"":1,""name"":""admin"",""description"":""admin
user"",""enabled"":true,""email"":"""",""password"":""dog""}
*user.json contents: (i.e., cat user.json)*
{""userid"":1,""name"":""admin"",""description"":""admin
user"",""enabled"":true,""email"":"""",""password"":""newpassword""}

However, it appears that when you stop then restart the controller you end
up with multiple admin users.  This means that the current system is not
enforcing unique usernames w/ PUT request (not sure if this is part of the
original spec).  So you will end up with a new user, instead of a modified
one.  There is no POST capability for users that I know of in the current
code, so it looks like the only way to do this is via psql right now.

Ryan Goulding

I've built aaa with the patch set referred to in the message's subject line
and verified that neutron northbound's integration test works when it is
applied...

Hi Wojciech,

Looks like in your project restructuring you may have removed the necessary <distributionManagement> sections from your parent pom somewhere. This section is needed by Maven in order to know where to push your artifacts. I noticed a few other projects have some patches in Gerrit to remove this section as well... so I'm not sure how the decision was made to start removing these sections but changes to Jenkins infra would be required for this to work.

I opened up a new thread on the mailing list thread here [1] to find out if this is a direction projects really want to go as I'm worried these Gerrit patches that are removing these sections will catch projects by surprise when their merge jobs start failing.

Thanh

At your convenience, please review these patches:
stable/lithium: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/23654/
master: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/23653/

It appears that when AAA switched to H2 at some point, the file name
convention changed to ""idmlight.db.mv.db"" from ""idmlight.db"".  Our
StoreBuilder.init() method is triggered on the non-existence of
""idmlight.db"", so it gets called every time the controller is started
resulting in multiple ""admin"" and ""user"" accounts.

The VM image that is breaking is the one being forked by PaxExam as part of
NN's integration test target.  The test code is already configured to keep
the run time folder around, but I don't know of a way to keep the fokred VM
image around after the test completes.

Subject: Re: [OpenDaylight TSC] Fwd: [Aaa-dev] ODL AAA project membership change

Hi All,
having spoken to the new team of AAA developers and having reviewed the deliverables status, we have identified some possible ways forward.
First off, a status update of the ""planned"" deliverables, as I currently see them. The color coding is indicative of resourcing and state:
1. MD-SAL based Token cache
Green. On track. No new external APIs introduced. No inter project dependencies.
2. Keystone Federation
Yellow. Code said to be 50% complete,  Feature s & POMs checked in. No inter project dependencies so far.

3. AAA Clustering and Persistence
Red. Dependency on Persistence project w/ new API to which the AAA store code would be refactored to. No resource in the team identified to take this forward.
The current thinking of the AAA team from the last call is that this deliverable should be re-scoped to an MD-SAL based credential store*
4. CI Testing
Green'ish. Test only. No new API. Draft test plan available. Robot test script resource still in place (but hasn't been heard of in a while)
5. Key Manager
Yellow. A new API needed, and a basic model for it has been supplied but it appears incomplete. This deliverable should also address Netconf/other-key-storage requirements, but these were not scoped so far (eg Netconf team didn't have cycles to look into this). I am waiting to hear from the resource(s) who were driving it, however they also appear to be affected.
Now my assessments are:
- The team sees item 3. above as the one that would provide most value to the community, and thus of highest priority. However in it's scoped form, ie using a new external galera DB + the dependency on the persitence project ,which also appears to have been affected by resource changes, the team considers that an MD-SAL based store approach would be more appropriate, also for the long term. The AAA team is visibly interested in pursing this approach, however it would in effect be a re-scoping of the item at a rather late stage. Nevertheless this, would be a better course of action that no AAA clustering support at all for Lithium.
- Keystone federation can proceed but new team taking over so it is at some ramp-up-time risk. I'll do my best to mitigate this by providing support, but ultimately it comes down to new folks who are taking over.
- The key manager in a simple MD-SAL store form as currently proposed could still be progressed, but we appear to don't have the resource for it (or at least it wasn't identified last week).
Given the above, I would like to ask for some feedback, and if necessary time on a call. The question & options as I see them are:
1. Should item 3 be re-scoped to an MD-SAL backed store at this stage, and still be aimed for Lithium?
2. Item 5 could continue if a resource shows up this week. Otherwise I'd take it off the table and put it back into the backlog.
3. Given that we're not only tight on the time-lines but also facing a skills-ramp-up time, assuming resources do come forward, should either/both of the above be taken down a notch and put on track as experimental features?
Regards,
Wojciech.

Thanks for the update Wojciech. Please let us know your next steps once you've had the chance to talk with the rest of the AAA developers.  Keystone federation was an important feature for OpenStack integration so if we can figure out a way to salvage that one, it would be great.  I understand about the Idm HA persistence.  If something has to get dropped that's a pretty good candidate.

Hi,

Will be chatting to the remaining AAA folks re the Lithium plan. The main deliverable at risk, from those that have been undertaken, appears to be the ?Openstack Keystone federation? project. The ""Idm HA persistence? may also be at risk; I understand that it?s mainly meant to come in via another project, but the people looking at it from the AAA appear to have also gone quiet. The MD-SAL based Token cache is looking good, and we have already delivered increased test coverage. The robot framework testing was last progressing, but what remains to be done needs to be still reviewed.

Hi Wojciech:

I'm sorry to hear that there is some churn in the resources for AAA.

We need to put a plan in place to ensure AAA's successful participation in Lithium.  The security features that AAA brings to OpenDaylight are not optional at this point.  Let's figure out what it is going to take to get AAA our of a RED status and into a GREEN status.

George has requested that you provide your M3 status using the provided template so that all the needed questions are answered.  Could you please do that so we all can get a better picture of where AAA is on track and where it is behind?

Next, given the resources and current skillsets available to AAA is there functionality that should be cut from the Lithium plan?  If so, will there be other projects affected by such a change?

Can you get with your fellow AAA developers and put a alternate plan in place?  I'm happy to help organize if that would be helpful to you.  Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks!

Phil.

Hi,

John and I have had a change in our work responsibilities and will be stepping down immediately from the AAA project.

HP is still committed to AAA and has identified the following contributors who are already ramping in the space, and will be joining the community immediately:
  -Eduardo Perez
  -Kailash Khalasi

While this change was unexpected, John and I really enjoyed working with this team and expect great things from it.

Best Regards,

John and Sherry

Hi Sharon,

I disagree with eliminating domain id and including ""domain (string)"" in
the user table.  This implicitly forces a 1:1 relationship between user and
domain (a user can currently have grants on multiple domains, and we should
continue to allow this for admin and super users).  Furthermore, the
combination of user at domain in the proposed Users table goes against 1st
Normal Form of db design;  each column should contain exactly one piece of
information.  ryan at coke and ryan at sprite can certainly refer to the same
user ""ryan"", and ""ryan"" should be treated as the same user (not two entries
in the user table).

To your points:

  *   I have considered both options, however keeping other entities seperated and undepended from the Domain will be causing issues with clustering and potential duplicate records per user (event not in a clustering environment). The advantages of keeping it as is are minor (I cannot even think of any), hence I have coupled the entities to the Domain.
  *   My first version was using a compound key (e.g. user+domain), however Wojciech pointed out that MDSAL does not have compound keys, hence I reverted back to the ""entity at domain"". Please see bullet #3 on slide 4...

The motivation is to exit the AAA from what I consider as far more 
dangerous implementation it is in...

I do see and understand your point, however considering the ""danger"" on 
both path, my intention is to have ""ryan at coke"" & ""ryan at sdn"" as two 
separate users. To my best knowledge keeping it ""as is"" is far more 
dangerous... If you don't have your relations enforced by the data store 
schema, we are going to face far more complex issues, challenges and 
performance elements.

How will you know which user belong to which domain? if ryan at coke is not 
the same user as ryan at sdn, how will you distinguish between them? 
Keeping the userID as a unique number?

If you keep the user ID, you cannot distinguish if multiple nodes are 
creating the same user or a different one for ""ryan"", hence you will 
forced to develop a highly complex locking mechanism which will be 
tightly coupled to the persistence implementation as to develop it you 
need to know its clustering method.

The locking mechanism you will develop it eventually a clustering 
mechanism and using MDSAL is the way to avoid re-developing a clustering 
mechanism. If we choose a different data store than MDSAL, the locking 
mechanism will act differently, for example if we choose Cassandra, 
which allows inserting from multiple nodes (not like MDSAL data broker 
that only the master is distributing the data), your locking mechanism 
will be different.

Performance, No way for an application to determinate which is the 
correct user without first querying the Domains to get the domain 
id->query the users to get a collection of ""ryan"" users -> query the 
grants to get the correct grant.

Those are just some points that pop into my mind...

- MD-SAL is currently the only cluster-capable store that works in ODL ""out
of the box"" (ie doesn't require some add-on installed). This is one key
motivation for the ""MD-SAL data store"".
- Yang does offer lists with ""compound keys"", however they're not very
commonly used. I believe that the reason is actually that they are
considered as strictly primary keys, while folks would like a ""map of maps""
type of construct, while allowing for direct keyed leaf access. Anyway, we
can attempt to use it and see.

Now, re the data model proposal, I think that the current model's primary
key is a problem not only in terms of concurrency; it lends itself for an
odd API, where a user has to know the system assigned user-id to ask for
the user-data.
Going with the user at domain, and dropping the domain column, or a compound
key would appear to be preferable.

Let's talk on Thursday, I don't think you fully understand the 
incentives behind my proposal or you are assuming implementation on some 
of them...
In my proposed model you do not need locking mechanism in a multiple 
node, nor you need expensive transaction locking. If something I have 
been thinking about, it will be how to avoid such things through 
coupling entities in the schema layer.

When dealing with persistence layer, please do not make any assumptions 
that there will only one option, I have very carefully applied and 
fitted the proposed model to support also MDAL, but not only so I could 
add SQL and NOSQL persistence layers for AAA. furthermore, I have also 
considered when doing my proposal a controller that is consists of 
multiple JVMs, hence MDSAL isn't an option in that route.

Just as an FYI, I am desperately trying to avoid doing something like 
this: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/24303/ as in a cluster 
environment this will simply not work without developing and coupling 
your solution to a specific clustering method, MDSAL or something else.

            Sharon.

""running code"" and not via the schema, you have to consider race 
condition between two machines trying to create the same entities and 
the same relation between them @ the same time. Assuming they can work 
in parallel, you have to develop a locking mechanism... To develop a 
locking mechanism you need to deeply understand your persistence layer 
and how does it do clustering as you do not want to re-write what is 
already supported by the persistence layer, but on the other hand you 
want to cover scenarios that the persistence layer clustering does not 
support. For example:

If the MDSAL is the persistence layer, we don't need to write a very 
sophisticated locking mechanism as the MDSAL cluster data broker is 
implementing RAFT, hence only the master writes to the Data Broker and 
propagate the transaction to the slaves so it might be simple.

But If we use Cassandra for example, it implements gossip protocol which 
allows different nodes in the cluster to write in parallel to the same 
""table"". In this case we need a locking mechanism as if entity creation 
will happen on two machines in parallel we will end up with two records 
in our table if the entity ID is uniquely generated per entity creation.

Today there isn't any locking mechanism so in a clustering environment 
it will not work. Developing a locking mechanism require you to couple 
it to persistence implemented protocol, which violates the plug-able 
persistence capabilities.

To solve this race condition we ""encode"" the entity relation in the 
model so @ worst case we will have double writing to the same record 
instead of two records.

I spoke with Wojciech earlier this week, and he is out on PTO tomorrow for
our weekly meeting tomorrow .  I'd still like to have the meeting, but
don't have a webex hosting account.  I was hoping we would be able to
utilize Google Hangouts using this perma-link:
https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gwhiraiz3p5zhj2hj6b7a2ordya just for
this week's meeting.  Please let me know if this is too problematic and we
will figure something else out.

I have been digging my way through the existing AuthZ models and code.  One
thing I noticed is that something has changed between helium and lithium;
 the authz code seems to be bypassed in lithium.  That is, none of the rest
calls are proxied through AuthzServiceImpl.  I have created the following
bug and will dig further into this issue:
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4139

On another note;  I believe that Shiro is completely capable of supporting
this model.  Shiro excels at ""instance level"" access control, which is one
step beyond RBAC which we currently have implemented.  I am working on the
mapping from our existing authZ models and Shiro, which will likely change
after today's weekly meeting regarding changing the AuthN model.

Because we used a hangout, I was unable to record todays meeting.  To
recap, we discussed the following:
Attendees:  Ryan, Sharon, Debalina & Carmen
1) Trello Board:  We moved ""idmlight automated testing"" to complete as
Carmen's patch was merged into the integration repository.
We moved ""hashed passwords"" into the complete category, as Sharon's patch
to add SHA1+salt was merged into our repository.
2) Sharon discussed his design thoughts concerning the AuthN model.  We
came to agree that replicating data may be necessary to support MD-SAL
AuthN data store.  Sharon also discussed his thoughts about creating an
interface layer between AAA and the underlying data store, which he will
report back on during our next meeting.
3) Carmen: finished the ""idmlight automated testing"" and is looking for
more testing.  I pointed Carmen to the AuthZ data store piece of the code,
which is largely untested.  Wojciech, you may have a better grasp as to
what should come next in terms of AAA testing support.
4) Ryan:  Submitted a patch showing a simple authZ postman collection.
Created Bug 4139 for the broken authz implementation in Li/Be.  Evaluating
a strategy to tie AuthZ into Shiro, which is currently blocked by Bug
4139.  Following up with the controller projects patch to upgrade RestConf
from JAX-RS 1.X to 2.X.

I have also added two new cards which are fairly simple and can be picked
up by anyone with spare cycles:
1) Add build hook to generate the idmlight.db.mv.db at build time so the
controller is never started with ""admin"", ""admin"" credentials.
2) Add a script to change password from CLI
3) Automated testing for Federated AAA.
If anyone is interested in these, please assign yourself the card and reach
out with any questions!

Thanks,

One thing that might be worth adding to this page are the steps needed to remove this admin/admin
user and create a new user with all it's needed credentials/roles/etc. That seems like one of the
first questions that would be asked when deploying ODL in a semi-serious environment :)

I have already documented in other parts of the wiki; changing passwords
and setting up federation is documented here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/AAA:Changing_Account_Passwords
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/AAA:Setting_Up_Federation

Adding/removing new users can be achieved using this (I did not write this
so I don't know how accurate it is):
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/a/ad/AAA_Idmlight_REST_APIs.xlsx

A lot of this will be changing.  I have started an effort to utilize Apache
Shiro instead of just home-grown code;  this effort is tracked through
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/24529/
<https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/24529/> &
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/AAA:Apache_Shiro_Migration and already
includes basic and LDAP Authentication.  These will take a bit to make
production ready, so take it for what it is worth at the moment!  Just a
sneak peek at the moment.

So with Ed's help we now have a new conclusion. If you look at the output of ""mvn dependency:tree"" you can see that there's a cyclic dependency being caused by a dependency features-netconf.

[INFO] +- org.opendaylight.netconf:features-netconf:xml:features:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT:runtime
[INFO] |  +- org.opendaylight.aaa:features-aaa:xml:features:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT:runtime

So we think that the root cause is that when building features-aaa we depend on features-netconf which in turn depends on the previous version of features-aaa which is pulling in the out of date features.xml and causing the build issue we are seeing.

We think that the cyclic dependency will need to be broken but I'm not sure where this should happen.

Is there someone on the netconf project able to look into what our options are here?
features-aaa seems to depend on netconf-api. AAA only needs org.opendaylight.controller.netconf.auth.AuthProvider, while NETCONF needs odl-aaa-netconf-plugin.

There is an explicit FIXME in netconf/features/netconf/src/main/resources/features.xml to this effect. This is a rehash of that old controller/aaa cycle, this time with 'odl-netconf-ssh', not 'odl-restconf'.

I don't remember the intended project graph, but I think both AAA and NETCONF should depend on controller. If that is the case, AuthProvider needs to be moved into AAA and we'll have only NETCONF depending on AAA -- cycle solved.

Alternatively we can move odl-aaa-netconf-plugin into NETCONF, as that may make more sense.


Thanks Robert,

So this is currently a blocker and we're unable to build Beryllium at all at this point. But sounds like we have some possible solutions, is there someone on the aaa or netconf projects who can take ownership of bug 4216 [1] and get this resolved?

I'm happy to help where I can.

Thanks,

Bumping this thread now, let me know if I got
any new e-mail list address or topic wrong.

So, Beryllium Restconf functionality is now provided by
Netconf project, and odl-aaa-authn is still
commented out of odl-restconf feature definition.

So far, I have found no trace of Lithium Controller
document promising Restconf with AAA,
so probably no official ""API contract"" was broken.
Also, I agree that Netconf does not need to depend on AAA.

However, odl-restconf was a well-known cross-project feature,
ODL users may just assume it works the same in Beryllium.

My current idea of how to satisfy everyone goes like this:
Remove odl-restconf from Netconf features
(citing odl-restconf-noauth as the new top-level feature),
but at the same time define odl-restconf
in Integration/distribution features (index/ ones).
That way, Netconf will still not depend on AAA,
but the cross-project feature will be available.

Similar approach may be used for *-rest and *-ui features.
Defining them in integration/distribution
will remove dependency cycles (e.g. Dlux and Openflowplugin).

Turns out ""auth"" was supposed to be missing only temporarily
during version bump (to avoid controller-aaa dependency cycle).
Now it is back: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/26602
That is, back in Netconf project.
It is still missing from Beryllium Controller features,
but nobody is using that anymore, am I right?

Subject: RE: [int/dist] [controller-dev] Beryllium odl-restconf without auth?

Hi Netconf and Integration/distribution devs.

Bumping this thread now, let me know if I got
any new e-mail list address or topic wrong.

So, Beryllium Restconf functionality is now provided by
Netconf project, and odl-aaa-authn is still
commented out of odl-restconf feature definition.

So far, I have found no trace of Lithium Controller
document promising Restconf with AAA,
so probably no official ""API contract"" was broken.
Also, I agree that Netconf does not need to depend on AAA.

However, odl-restconf was a well-known cross-project feature,
ODL users may just assume it works the same in Beryllium.

My current idea of how to satisfy everyone goes like this:
Remove odl-restconf from Netconf features
(citing odl-restconf-noauth as the new top-level feature),
but at the same time define odl-restconf
in Integration/distribution features (index/ ones).
That way, Netconf will still not depend on AAA,
but the cross-project feature will be available.

Similar approach may be used for *-rest and *-ui features.
Defining them in integration/distribution
will remove dependency cycles (e.g. Dlux and Openflowplugin).

Vratko.

Thanks for your prompt reply.  I apologize for not getting back sooner;  I
have been doing quite a bit of research into this one.  Simply put, there
aren't any non *GPL licensed Java Radius clients.  That said, both Tiny
Radius and JRadius (the ""top"" *GPL licensed radius clients) haven't been
updated in nearly half a decade so I don't know how good those are either.

For now, Radius is not a top priority for Beryllium release.  I am working
on creating my own basic Radius client plugin based on Apache sources that
can support frame building for basic AuthN and AuthZ.  I think this will be
a better approach for AAA project needs.  Please feel free to disregard
this request, and thanks very much for taking a look into this for me!

I am working on code to migrate AAA project to use Apache Shiro Java
Security Framework.  I notice that there is an effort going on to upgrade
Jersey from 1.17 to 2.8;  what is the timeline for this?  For now, I have
built in ""Shiro support"" for 1.X versions of Jersey, though it is not being

versions of jersey.  There are several comments mentioning Jersey migration

We?ve been having some issues with getting the patch that fixes this pass verify jobs. It?s failing due to some weird reason where single feature test is looking at maven central for opendaylight-karaf-empty.

patches for AAA and netconf (restconf) which are currently in review for
the Jersey 2.X / JAXRS 2.X upgrade:
NETCONF: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/27397/
AAA:           https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/27584/
There are other projects that may be affected by these changes, so we are
going to issue a weather advisory later today concerning the change (as
well as prepare some more patch sets for affected projects).  This is a
much larger change that affects several more projects than we originally
anticipated.

2)
*Shiro: *No,  the odl-aaa-shiro feature has not been added to the
integration project.  This is due to the fact that it will likely never be
advertised, as it is more of a replacement for odl-aaa-authn.  When the
time comes to make the switch, we will point the odl-aaa-authn feature to
install the odl-aaa-shiro feature (which is really internal only).
*MD-SAL: * No, this work is still in review here
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/26420/.  We *NEED* to merge this
patch prior to adding the feature in integration.

3) We have not submitted a plan yet,  I can work on this today & tomorrow
and provide an update to you.  Our main system tests were merged to the
integration project in this patch
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/23385/.

Please let me know if you need anything else, and I will gladly help out.

I am assuming you are using stable/lithium based on the stack trace you
provided, is this correct?  My initial guess is this;  you are providing
""admin:admin"" in plain text while it should be provided in Base64.  Current
versions of Postman should automatically convert this;  which version are
you using?  I just tested this with stable/lithium and ensured it worked
properly for me.

I checked ?idmlight.db? on my side and didn?t find it. the permission of kara folder are correct.
One possible root cause is that there is no database server on my host. May I know which kind of database is needed for Opendaylight? Mysql or others?
BTW, I?m using one embedded platform, so some packages might not be included in my rootfs.  So may I know where I can see the package dependency for opendaylight ?

Maxime et al.,

This distribution is quite old, and there was a JDBC driver change between Helium-SR4 and Lithium;  the new driver is a pure java implementation and thus is a bit more portable.  My initial gut reaction is to recommend loading a newer version.  I do not have a PC using that architecture, but I'll try to help.  Helium-SR4 came out shortly after I started on the AAA project;  but here is a bit of debug information for what its worth.  First of all, try to check if the database file is created.  From your karaf home directory, execute the following:

*1. Please provide updates on any previously-incomplete items from prior
milestone readouts.*
I submitted our system test plan here
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/AAA:Beryllium_System_Test_Plan.

*2. Has your project achieved API freeze, i.e., all externally accessible
APIs [Stable and Provisional] will not be modified after now? Yes/No*

Yes for Java APIs.

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/file:%255Eaaa-authn-api/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/api/.%252B+status:merged+project:aaa

There may be a name change in our web filter depending on some further
testing from TokenAuthFilter.java to AAAShiroFilter.java.  This will only
affect the netconf project, and we will file a formal API waiver if this
changes.

*3. What are the current word counts (total and per-document) for your
project?*

* 305 lines, 1933 words
* ./manuals/user-guide/src/main/asciidoc/aaa/aaa.adoc

*4. Has your project met the requirements to be included in Maven Central
[0]?*

Yes.

*5. Were there any project-specific deliverables planned for this
milestone? Yes/No*

Working to merge https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/26420/.

*6. Have you started automated system testing for your top-level
features. Yes/No*

Yes.  Basic sanity testing occurs with this job I believe,

https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/integration/job/integration-csit-1node-basic-all-beryllium/
.

The test code is found in integration/test/csit/suites/aaa/idmlite/.

*7. Have you updated the wiki [3] with any ports used, including for
testing?*
Yes, we updated the ports utilized in the appropriate wiki.


Let me know if anything else is needed.

Thanks,

the idmlite job is now running, but failing.  it at least needs this:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/28484/

but, I also wonder if something basic is broken (test side, or API side)
as I see the basic trouble is that the test is getting no response from
/auth/v1/domains (port 8282).  That basic trouble is seen in the suite
setup so none of the tests will run.

here's the job:

Or you can use the following clause to remove them from the project fact page as PTL.

ODL SFC uses jersey-client to communicate with southbound devices that
support REST (sfc-sb-rest). Basically ODL SFC sends HTTP REST to
switches/routers that support it.

https://github.com/opendaylight/sfc/blob/master/sfc-sb-rest/src/main/java/or
g/opendaylight/sfc/sbrest/provider/task/WsTask.java

Let me be clear that our test coverage of the actual sending of packets is
not very good since we need a actual device and unit testing this is kind of
tricky. 

But if there is anything I can do to locally upgrade jersey-client locally
and perform some manual tests I?m willing to pitch in.

Thanks,

Hi All,

I am coordinating a merge of the patches for the Jersey and JAX-RS upgrade
for netconf and aaa projects on Tuesday October 27th 2015.  For more
information on the change, please refer to the corresponding weather page
entry [1].  I tested these changes against all downstream projects that had
a stable master branch on my local development system.  I've done my best to
try to avoid any breakages;  if you notice something wrong, please inform me
ASAP via this thread.

Thanks and Best Regards,

Ryan Goulding

<http://username}@git.opendaylight.org:29418/sfc.git>*
*> cd sfc*
*> mvn clean install*
Then do any extra testing you have in mind.  Ordering of these steps is
important since netconf depends on aaa and not the other way around.  I
will do the same thing later this afternoon; please report back any
findings you discover!  One thing that is hanging me up with sfc right now
is I keep running into this Error when running unit tests (*even without
any of my changes using a -U update flag*):
Failed tests:
  SfcProviderServicePathAPITest.testReadAllServiceFunctionPaths:227 Must be

Any ideas on this?

I have added in the aaa-dev list, as we try to keep discussions public so
other members of the community can chime in.  The current architecture is
able to support several forms of IdP through proxying through Apache;
 basically we rely upon mod_auth_lookup apache extensions and essentially
re-use the federated IdP code.  However, only SSSD is ""supported"", and I
have had some issues setting up some parts of that.  The idea is we gather
roles stored in the IdP to determine roles in the AAA system through
mapping rules.

Per the AAA team discussion at the 2015 ODL Summit, we are now pursuing
federated IdP using Apache Shiro.  Apache Shiro comes with built in support
for LDAP, SQL, Basic and a few other providers.  The other ones we can
create through extension of the Shiro AuthorizingRelam class.  A good
portion of this code is in the code base, but currently blocked by a few
major version upgrades I am pursuing across projects.

What type of system (i.e., protocol) are you interested in trying to use
for federation?  As I mentioned earlier, integration is meant to tie the
whole project together, and is probably not useful for this new use case
you have brought up.  You will probably want to clone the aaa.git
repository which contains the existing federated code.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Ryan Goulding

Thanks Ryan for these useful information.

Sorry my previous response was not clear; I meant IdP by third-party
application.
I would first begin by analyzing the code and make basic modifications of
direct authentication behavior before federated authentication.
I have cloned the integration distribution [1] then git checkout
stable/lithium; build with maven works fine and I can access to karaf
console without any installed feature.
So I wonder how to configure the distribution to use the ""aaa project"" I
modified instead of the default one for authenticating all services and
users that would access on ODL resources ?

Please may someone send out the sequence diagrams and UML model of aaa
project ?

Best regards

Is the third party IdP application something you are creating as part of
your company?  Although ODL certainly appreciates contributions from
everyone, we have to be careful that all code merged is vendor-neutral and
promotes the good of the project, not a specific company.  Since AAA is an
offset 0 project, there are also some pretty strict rules concerning what
code we can change during certain phases of the development cycle.  Thus,
it is good to discuss your intentions openly so it is clear what is allowed
and not allowed.

I encourage you to join our weekly meeting today at 9AM PST [1] and join
our mailing list [2].  Generally the meeting is the best place to get
started since we can give you ideas about certain needed changes, since the
regulars are pretty familiar with the pitfalls of the current solution.  We
also have a few big changes that are up in the air that will be merged
soon, which would be a good place for you to start looking as well.  Our
wiki [3] has some high level drawings of the Lithium based architecture,
though some of that has changed in Beryllium and we have not had a chance
to update it.

WRT the code, you need to download the aaa.git repository to see the code.
git clone ssh://{your_username}@git.opendaylight.org:29418/aaa.git

Hope this helps.

Ryan, my end goal is to make federated authentication between OpenStack and
OpenDayLight by modifying keystone pipelines and aaa behavior.

Since it's my first time using aaa project, I would first study ""Basic HTTP
Authentication"" implementation based only on login & password by analyzing
java classes in folder [2]  and then modify them for redirecting users'
credentials
(login&password) to a remote server that will tell aaa wheter or not to
allow a user accessing on ODL resoures.  The exchange between aaa and the
remote server will be done using simple REST API; the idea is to allow
external users/processes having 'admin' or 'user' access right in ODL
without being registered in h2 database before their authentication.

I will deal with ""Federated Authentication"" after understanding main aaa
module's behavior thanks to the previous step.

So after cloning and modifying [1], how may I configure ODL's controller to
use the aaa I have modified ?

May I know also how ODL register users in h2 database ?

infrastructure only needs to accept the policy defined by moon.
authorization enforcement (in OpenStack): the security policy in Moon is
enforced by authorization mechanism in Keystone and Nova. All the
operations in Keystone and Nova are controlled and validated by Moon.
(OpenStack is not
the only scope of moon)

Actually the project does not focussed on the usage of ODL as
MechanismDriver for Neutron ML2 pluin and as you said before in such a case
authentication between AAA and Keystone is succesully achieved using
configuration [2] but I just want to control the aaa authorization from
moom by redirecting authentication requests to moon via API calls.

Hope it is more clear ?

project.  In his time with the AAA project, Sharon has helped push 6K lines
of code [1], fixed several bugs, and provided expert engineering in
creation of the AAA MD-SAL data store.  This is all on top of contributing
to several other projects in ODL.  He is professionally affiliated with
Cisco Systems.

AAA project (3 votes of +1 and no dissenters for nearly a week).  He has
received +1 from the only two active committers to the AAA project, myself

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/owner:saichler%2540cisco.com+project:aaa+status:merged

I dug into the changes and asked Ryan a few questions in-person.

Observations:

* Four merged AAA changes total (five showing, but one was reverted and
  re-submitted). However, there may be additional patches that were authored by
  Sharon and submitted by others (Wojciech).
* Two of four non-reverted changes are >1000 line changes.
* Most of the committers to AAA aren't active, don't attend meetings and don't
  review code. Sharon does attend meetings. Ryan needs additional committers to
  maintain healthy code review practices.

I would prefer to see a larger set of well-attributed contributions. However,
if they say they contributed to changes for which they didn't get credit I
believe them, and I don't want to hamper the project by not giving them the
committers they want/need.

aaa-authn does not have a dependency on jersey-client, because we have no
need for it in the current offering.  If you are trying to extend the
aaa-authn bundle directly then you are going to have to add the dependency
on jersey-client to the aaa-authn/pom.xml.

Essentially it all comes down to the last line in the good log. If it

Are you using the auth or cluster auth feature?


Please try the following patch that is being reviewed, it might help in this case.

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/29608/


When in karaf and the bundle does not come up, please execute the following command to see if the karaf identifies any issue:

bundle:diag


If there isn't any output of the above command, it might be that the bundles are still loading.


If nothing happens after a min or so, try to invoke the command:

do the following:

""?feature:list -i | grep aaa""

and then

""feature:install <the aaa feature that is installed>""


When you get the output error, just send it to me.

If you don't get an error, you might need to wait for the bundles to come up.



Thanks,

           Sharon.

Bad log: https://gist.github.com/59fdf70a13a0b57a11f0

Good log: https://gist.github.com/3ffe94770ba777227798

Essentially it all comes down to the last line in the good log. If it doesn't show up, I'm hosed and I just shutdown Karaf, click my heels thrice and try again :)

Any thoughts?

(yes, I have been doing quite a bit lately and have cleaned out my M2 for various reasons maybe 10 times since Monday).

Hi All,

The operation fails and the browser prompts ""Authentication Required"" prompt again.  The issue is seen only when I install odl-mdsal-clustering feature.

              Restconf was working fine after executing the below command in one of our machines. But in other machines it was not working.

We are not able to change the credentials because of the issue. We need help in resolving the issue.

With limited browsing of the logs on my mobile it seems that the real issue here is the data broker not getting started and not electing a leader after long...long time, hence AAA just exposed an issue that was ""undercover"" as we started to use the MDSAL data broker in clustering mode.

Reverting the AAA code will just ""cover"" the issue again as you will be able to login with the AAA using the local H2 database but your controller/cluster will be actually useless without any data broker (unless your app is not using the data broker).

Can you submit the log to the controller-dev mailing list? Please include some description of your setup, the number of openflow connected swithes and your clustering configuration so the specialist can help fine tune it.

Not sure it is relevant any more but it might be that you enable persistence on the ""operational"" data store and getting hit by the statistic manager or in this version the statistic manager is not cluster aware so with openflow clustering each node in the clustering is pushing the data so please highlight that info in this email with the logs.

We are still investigating the root cause for this, and discovered it may
be due to loading latencies of the controller, or some other underlying
issues that have not yet been uncovered.  In order to alleviate some of the

Ryan,

I've confirmed this on alto, nemo, and groupbasedpolicy so far. There's a list available here of merge job statuses:

    https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/Merge-Jobs/

If you look for Yellow status (UNSTABLE) there may be other projects suffering the same.

See the link [1] for client concept (slid 5). It seems that ODL distingues
human users and processes (programs) that want to access to resources.
By analyzing org.opendaylight.aaa package, I have seen that dlux has client

Could be similar. Would you mind running SFC, trying to login to console,
and repeat a few times and report the consistency? 5 should be plenty to
determine if this is indeed a persistent or temporal issue.

I'm playing with a fix now for GBP and once I get root cause I'll see if
SFC has same problem.

We took out md-sal as the *default* backing datastore, so h2 should be used
unless you specified otherwise (I doubt this is the case).  There were
about 5 patches, so there is a small chance that if you missed one then you
could be using the old md-sal store implementation.  When did you try to

Dear All,

I have been trying to integrate openstack keystone authentication with active directory via Radius. But am not able to figure it out yet.
I have tried looking through the federated keystone concept but did not get any configuration for the external Identity providers.Can you guys provide configurations for users to manage Identity Providers (IdPs) and establish a set of rules to map federation protocol attributes.

I asked because I wanted to ensure you were using the latest AAA
artifacts... the md-sal ones don't import the odl-restconf.  Maven will
cache artifacts for a waiting period if you do not force an update in your
local m2 repository.  I pulled the sfc code base this morning and ensured
that the h2 datastore is used for AAA (after installing
odl-sfc-provider-rest, you will see a file called idmlight.db.mv.db file in
your karaf root directory).  I then ensured I could make 1000 rest calls
with authentication, which also seemed to work.  I was also able to access
apidocs after install odl-sfc-ui feature.

Can you please provide:
1) the exact features you are installing
2) the rest call you are attempting to make, including all applicable
authentication headers
3) a karaf log
4) are you in a cluster?

Hi Ryan,
See the link [1] for client concept (slid 5). It seems that ODL distingues human users and processes (programs) that want to access to resources.
By analyzing org.opendaylight.aaa package, I have seen that dlux has client credentials (dlux/secrete) in ClientManager class. Any idea about what they correspond to ?

Although domains exist as a field in AAA (mandatory per user), they are largely not used.  If a user has a ""grant"" (link between user and role), they can make any rest call (in the current code base).  This functionality slid off the radar over time since there has been a high turnover in AAA team since its inception.  For now, it is recommended to only use the default sdn domain;  we can add support for multi-tenancy as an item to our trello backlog.  Right now the mapping simply does not exist.

Most REST clients including postman have functionality to add authentication which do the encoding for you.  What rest call causes this error/is it properly encoding the authorization credentials?

Hi Naresh,

I asked because I wanted to ensure you were using the latest AAA artifacts... the md-sal ones don't import the odl-restconf.  Maven will cache artifacts for a waiting period if you do not force an update in your local m2 repository.  I pulled the sfc code base this morning and ensured that the h2 datastore is used for AAA (after installing odl-sfc-provider-rest, you will see a file called idmlight.db.mv.db file in your karaf root directory).  I then ensured I could make 1000 rest calls with authentication, which also seemed to work.  I was also able to access apidocs after install odl-sfc-ui feature.

Can you please provide:
1) the exact features you are installing

take place after this point? Yes


https://github.com/opendaylight/docs/blob/master/manuals/user-guide/src/main/asciidoc/aaa/aaa.adoc

Some edits may be needed when https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/26472/
is merged to include
setting up LDAP.





5. Were there any project-specific deliverables planned for this milestone?
Yes



Yes, described in question #1.





6. Are you running at least one basic automated system test job for each
top-level feature?



Yes



Stables Features

7. Do your stable features fulfill quality requirements (i.e. unit and/or
integration test coverage of at least 75%)?



No, plans are to increase code coverage over time.



8. Are you running several automated system test jobs including
functionality, cluster, scalability, performance, longevity/stability for
each stable feature? Yes/No

AAA project was using osgi activators to wire the services between the sub projects. I have converted idmlight to use config subsystem, going through all the steps in the toaster tutorial. Starting from defining a yang file for it, adding the required build section in the pom.xml file & etc.

There is a patch under review for this activity now. To explain how to do that it will take a few sessions of code walk through, which i can't really place in a single email...

1)  You need to surround the stuff after ""-d"" in single quotes.  Here is an example:

I don't know what you did to get 401 or 405;  if you remove the single quotes you should get a 500 error... I tried this locally and confirmed thats what happens.

2) Can you elaborate on what you mean?  The keystone plugin is meant to authenticate against keystone, which is part of OpenStacks IdM.

Hope this helps.

for letting me know.  It is hard to debug since [1] masked the SQLException
stacktrace.  I see two main issues:
1) No synchronization barrier around table creation, causing the ""table
already exists jdbc SQLException) [2]
2) SQLExceptions are masked by IDMStoreException (which makes it impossible
for me to tell why the ""readDomain()"" call failed. [3]

I have filed bugs for both of these and I am working on fixes right now.
Whether they are related is not possible to tell with this stack trace.
Hopefully after I fix Bug4782 we can tell if this happens again.  I
apologize for any inconveniences.

I noticed in your logs there's a few lines that look like this:

[INFO] There is 1 error reported by Checkstyle 6.2 with
check-license.xml ruleset.[ERROR]
src/test/java/org/opendaylight/aaa/h2/persistence/H2StoreTest.java[1]
(header) RegexpHeader: Line does not match expected header line of
'^/[*]+$'.[WARNING] checkstyle:check violations detected but
failOnViolation set to false


This means that the license checker found some files missing license
headers but your build is not failing as I would have expected it to. Looks
like something in your pom configuration is overriding the license checkers
fail mode.

Can someone investigate so that we can get the checker failure condition
re-enabled, and also resolve the bad headers in Java files too?

Thanks,

Thanh

I vaguely remember a bug for this, but I can't find it.

Sometimes in CSIT jobs, I see that the controller is not deemed ""UP"" after it
fails to get a 200 status code from /restconf/modules after ten minutes.  I
think maybe it's because there is trouble in AAA somewhere.  This exception
is probably relevant:

2016-01-23 01:17:21,322 | ERROR | config-pusher    | AAAIDMLightModule                | 193 -
org.opendaylight.aaa.idmlight - 0.3.0.SNAPSHOT | Failed to initialize data in store
org.opendaylight.aaa.api.IDMStoreException: org.opendaylight.aaa.h2.persistence.StoreException

example console output:
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/controller/job/controller-csit-3node-clustering-only-beryllium/517/consoleFull


The above example is a cluster job, but I've seen it in single node
jobs too.


Do we have a bug for this?  I don't know of a reliable way to reproduce,
but something is broken it seems and we should try to fix it.

Thanks,
JamO

PS.  full exception, but you can get from console log too:

We are from the Controller Shield Project group whose primary goal is to create a security related repository within ODL. In ODL Be, we could create a repository that holds OpenFlow PacketIn related security information. 

As part of our ODL Boron activities, we would like to extend our project to include ODL NB access related security information. In this regard, we are looking for successful and failed login attempts to ODL. 

It will be of great help to us if you could tell  whether  there is a way in the current AAA implementation to get this information of failed and successful login attempts.

If already implemented we would like to know how to enable the particular accouting service. If not implemented is there a workaround for getting this piece of info.

Currently these are persisted to the karaf.log, which is unfortunately the
only interface currently.  Technically, you could scrape the information
out of there, but that is painful.  That said, in Boron we are more than
willing to help provide hooks for this information;  I will add this to the
release backlog.  I imagine we could create an event listener architecture,
and you could register as a listener for login attempts.

controller-csit-3node-clustering-all-beryllium. I assume they run the same
car/people tests - the difference is that ""only"" installs only the cluster
test app and ""all"" installs all (40 something?) apps. The ""all"" tests
failed due to ""No RPC implementation"" for people which likely means the
cluster test app hadn't started yet due to all the others apps to load. So
the test would need to retry.

However why do we even need to re-run the car/people cluster tests with all
apps installed? The point of the test suite is to test clustering
functionality with a specific yang model, as such we don't need 40+ other
apps installed to do that, especially since the ""only"" tests succeed.
Otherwise I'm afraid we're going to keep seeing intermittent failures due
to slower startup.

There's no blocking issues for TSDR. The failure was due to the csit
automation scripts issues. Premnath is fixing that issue right now. The
csit job failure for TSDR should not block TSDR from being released in

Per the discussion in last week's MD-SAL call, I have compiled a short list
of potential items the AAA team might discuss during the upcoming ODL
Developer's Forum at the end of the month.  This is by no means a promise
to deliver on these features, but more a way to advertise possible
improvements and align the community on plausible solutions.

1) Radius AAA Realm

- There are no known License-Friendly versions of Radius Client available.

- We may need to spin a lightweight Radius impl similar to [1]

2) Stabilize the MD-SAL Store Plugin

- Implicitly, this involves conversion of bundles from
Activator/BundleTracker(s) to Configuration Subsystem.  I have heard there
are possible efforts of moving away from this architecture, to something
like Aries Blueprint;  I think this is another good topic to bring up at
the Developer's Forum.

- [2] explains how to possibly speed up AAA MD-SAL Store Plugin loading.

3) Improvements to Authorization

- Clean up the AuthZ Broker Facade

- Allow applications to register themselves with AuthZBrokerFacade [3]

- Advanced filtering for models

This is by no means comprehensive, and is mostly just what I have derived
from open bugs and asks from the community.

Glad to hear you are on board for the Developer's Forum!  I plan on
sectioning off a part of tomorrows meeting to discuss Boron planning;  if
you are interested at a sneak preview you can take a look at the authz
bundles in the aaa project.  FWIW this code has not been tested since
Lithium (by me), and I am not sure what shape it is currently in.  My hello
world example (based on the existing code) is here [1].  Currently working
on moving your other changes related to certs in... there is some Jenkins
trouble preventing this at the moment but it is in progress :).

I used to have a simple app over Lithium where I had organized users within
domains and had roles set for each user. Once I moved to Be, I realize
things aren't straightfwd.

The following used to be the workflow I followed after installing the
odl-aaa-authn feature.
1. Create domain XYZ
2. Create user ""alice"" for XYZ
3. Create role ""admin"" for XYZ
4. Set user ""alice"" to role ""admin""

Once I go through the workflow, I used to be able to login as ""alice"" and
get access to the REST API for inventory etc. But, now with upgrading to
Be, the login box keeps coming up repeatedly because the BasicAuth code is
assuming domain of ""alice"" to be ""sdn"".

Is there a different way I should've logged in so that the aaa feature can
figure out the domain name? Is my issue related to
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4042 which is supposed to be
resolved in Be?

Thanks

Two things to mention here:
1) *In Lithium the prerequisite was to specify domain as part of the
Authorization header*.  I.e., instead of doing:
curl -u alice:password
http://192.168.56.102:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes
you would need to do:
curl -H ""Authorization: Basic YWxpY2U6cGFzc3dvcmQ6YWxwaGFiZXQ=""
http://192.168.56.102:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes
where YWxpY2U6cGFzc3dvcmQ6YWxwaGFiZXQ= is base64( ""alice:password:alphabet""
)

This is what I inherited as an existing interface when I became PTL of AAA,
which is technically not standards compliant.  Support for multi-tenancy is
still very weak in ODL (even if you specify a user belongs to a non-""sdn""
domain, it doesn't actually mean anything in the current implementation
since we don't do domain-based filtering on RESTCONF endpoints.  *This is
functionality that is on the table for Boron timeframe though!*

2) RESTCONF utilizes the new AAAFilter as of Beryllium, which assumes ""sdn""
domain because multi-tenancy didn't actually lead to any functional gain.
As you point out, this is technically a bug, so I have submitted a bug [1]
and patch [2] to fix this behavior.  That said, assume that ""domain"" is
more of a placeholder without much functionality whatsoever in this
release.  Since adding the domain after a second colon is technically not
standards compliant for Basic Authorization, we will use the following
scheme:

curl -u admin at sdn:admin
http://192.168.56.102:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes

If no ""@domain"" exists, the ""sdn"" default domain will be assumed for
backwards compatibility.  This should be merged soon and will be cherry
picked back into stable/beryllium.

Ryan Goulding

Regarding #1: I have a slight correction. In Lithium, domain is ignored.
So, as long as the user name as unique across domains, there is no login
issue. But in Beryllium, the authentication pays attention to the domain.
So, a mistakenly assumed ""sdn"" domain will cause login failure. However,
using oauth tokens worked fine in the domain (i.e., scope) context and
let's me login with ""bearer"" auth mechanism.

Regarding the user:password:domain convention, I did figure from the code
that the request I must send should be ""Basic
base64encode('alice:alice:alphabet')"", but that actually doesn't work
either. When my curl sends out the following header,

* Connected to 192.168.56.102 (192.168.56.102) port 8181 (#0)
    GET /restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
    Host: 192.168.56.102:8181
    Accept: */*
    Authorization: Basic YWxpY2U6YWxpY2U6YWxwaGFiZXQ=

After some debugging, I see that the code in
org.apache.shiro.web.filter.authc.AuthenticatingFilter.executeLogin()
creates a token only using the userName and password field. So, the domain
is lost subsequently and the ""sdn"" domain is applied. This causes the login
failure because ""alice"" is not available in that domain.

Thanks for pushing a fix that will allow using ""alice at alphabet"" as the
username. This is generally acceptable convention and I'm glad it will be
cherry picked for Beryllium.

Can you clarify two more points:
1. What domain-based filtering on RESTCONF endpoints can we expect in Boron?
2. ""...multi-tenancy didn't actually lead to any functional gain"" in
Beryllium.

Srini.

experimental.  It is essentially a Facade for the DOMDataBroker.

Shiro filtering examples are being added to the formal documentation, but
they are based on [1].  Shiro authorization is based on a web url pattern,
and a set of required roles.  In Beryllium, these rules don't have the
notion of domain, and they are meant for coarse grained RBAC.  A simple
example is to provide the following rule above ""/** = authcBasic"" in
shiro.ini:
/streams/ = authcBasic, roles[admin]

Then restart the controller.  This essentially sections of the ""
http://localhost:8181/restconf/streams/"" endpoint for users with the admin
role only.  Wildcards can be added (odl-aaa-authz got the wildcarded url
idea from Shiro, from what I have heard from past contributors).

If you've already registered for the Boron Developer Design Forum (DDF)  
please disregard this email and I look forward to seeing you next Monday.

HOWEVER, if you haven't registered, I'd like to reiterate the importance of  
getting together face to face with both members of your particular project  
as well as the rest of the OpenDaylight development community.  Not only  
can you kickstart development activities for Boron within your project, but  
we will also discuss critical project-wide topics such as the changes to  
the build environment and Release process, as well as key new features and  
technologies soon to be added to the platform that may be of significant  
importance to you... and then just getting to put faces with irc-handles is  
always a big win for everybody.

Please attend if it is at all possible.  The DDF is the *best* way to meet  
and work with other key developers in the ODL community to make great  
advances on what is important to you.

The DDF logistics are:
When:  Next Monday & Tuesday (February 29th, and March 1st), 9:00am to  
5:00pm each day
Where:  San Mateo Marriott San Francisco Airport
               1770 S Amphlett Blvd
               San Mateo, CA 94402

Remember we run the event as both a standard technical conference and also  
as an unconference.  You are welcome and encouraged to submit discussion  
topics important to you on this wiki page:

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Events:Boron_Dev_Forum

Please post any new entries to the bottom of that page.  I'll collect the  
topics on a daily basis and populate the pre-defined schedule with them.   
That schedule is located here:

http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/opendaylight-developer-design-forum/program/schedule

We will also have additional rooms set aside for project teams and/or  
cross-project groups to get together to work through issues and ideas in an  
ad-hoc (aka unconference) style.

Hello openflowjava-devs,

I am working on OFJ to allow users to configure cipher-suites to use with
SSLEngine. (https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/34942/).

I am trying to test it by configuring the cipher suites supported by
SunProvider 1.8, for e.g. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384. (
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html
).
However, I see an IllegalArgumentException exception indicating that the
cipher suite is not supported.

Do you have any inputs or leads on why I could be seeing this exception
(version problem?). Could you please give some advice to be able to test
this with supported cipher suite names?

How did you configure your JCE?  Did you disable bouncy castle in
custom.properties (comment it out) and just rely on the default JCE
Provider?  If so, then the default SUN Provider doesn't actually provide
that cipher;  you need to use SunJSSE (and Java 8 since it isn't a part of
Java 7 SunJSSE impl, but from your stack trace it looks like you are using
1.8.0_60 so that is good).  The provider ordering is specified in

version 1.8 Provider"". Looks like openflowjava uses the default Sun
provider. And that is how I used the cipher suite name to test.

Here is the provider ordering on my system:





*security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sunsecurity.provider.2=sun.security.rsa.SunRsaSignsecurity.provider.3=sun.security.ec.SunECsecurity.provider.4=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Providersecurity.provider.5=com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCEsecurity.provider.6=sun.security.jgss.SunProvider*

I would like to allow RESTCONF resource access for admin only by putting
the following using REST client:

http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/authorization-schema:simple-authorization

{
    ""simple-authorization"": {
        ""policies"": [

                ""authorization"": ""authorized""
            }
        ]
    }
}

but the generated token from user's credentials can still read inventory
nodes
curl -X GET -k -s -H 'Authorization: Bearer
d091df4f-860a-3284-9836-079e2cf2e3de'
http://localhost:8080/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes

Are there additional configurations for Authz policies with Be ?

Does shiro handle all authorisation requests or it coexists with previous
authz engine  ?

It seems that aaa-authn-model-rev.2014-10-29 is not accessible from YANG UI

I tried the following command (the token is generated from admin

http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/aaa-authn-model:tokencahe

I get the following response:

            {
                ""error-message"": ""The module named 'aaa-authn-model' does

                ""error-type"": ""protocol""
            }
        ]
    }
}

See the attached log [log_aaa_authn_model].

Without writing tokencache in mdsal DataStore, authn generates new token
whenever [1] is executed. It does not take care neither about previous
authentication request nor token expiration time.

According to the log file, it seems that Shiro handles authorization
requests even without any configuration in shiro.ini. Is this the expected
behavior ?

On the other hand, I have set breakpoints in AuthzServiceImpl
(org.opendaylight.aaa.authz.srv) in eclipse debugging mode but authz
requests never pass throught it as in Lithium.

I have a few questions:

-     Is this possible to implement Realm implementing both authentication
and authorization services ?

-     How to set shiro authz policies in shiro.ini ?

-     Is shiro able to filter request coming from /restconf/* just by
adding /streams/ = authcBasic, roles[admin] in shiro.ini

Srini is looking for a way to configure the certificates to be used with OVSDB SSL/TLS connections. The OVSDB library supports SSL but the certificate management is outside the scope. Do you have any ideas on how to specify certificates? I imagine this has to have been talked about already. I think this should be something centrally managed for ODL. We have the bug [1] opened to track the issue which also has some comments.

The cert-provider functionality is still in its infancy;  master AAA now
includes the ability to generate keys.  However, we are not clustering them
or persisting them to the data store yet.  This is functionality that is in
our Boron release plan but has not been tackled yet;  I am sorry if you
were told differently.  It is a gap in ODL's current Beryllium
implementation.

As for setting up SSL for OVSDB, I have never done it.  I don't know
whether ODL's OVSDB currently supports setting up SSL/TLS... it has been
about 6 months since I have looked at the southbound code.  Sam, any
thoughts here?  I would have to imagine that you just place the keystore in
a well known location if the functionality exists.  That said, I am not
sure it was ever tackled...

Srinivasa mentions in https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5306 that support I OVSDB southbound is not complete and has also added some code to read certificate info off these, but such code doesn?t exist yet. Other than AAA, we will still need some configuration to enable/disable SSL support for Passive and active OVSDB connections. Active may require field in yang to specify SSL as a type for connection-info.

Sam,
So the question now is do we wait for AAA to be ready for use or do we put in some stop-gap code to support TLS/SSL? My interest in it comes from certain deployments/devices not allowing non-SSL connection to TOR devices. I think we need this support in Beryllium too.

Thoughts?

Subject: Re: [ovsdb-dev] TLS support and certificates

After re-reading this thread, it looks like ODL OVSDB does support SSL/TLS.  Sam et. al, where does the keystore need to be located to get picked up?  I'd imagine we just need to make sure the AAA key generation code drops the keystore in the correct filesystem location...

certificate sores and such seemed to be something other projects in ODL
would need and AAA was a good place for it so we were waiting on pieces
there. OVSDB needs knobs to enabled or disable the support and use the
common code form AAA. It would be good to see what can be done there and
how OVSDB can use it.

If that takes too long, then I agree we should do a workaround similar to
the current patch.

Ryan,

yes, I think that is the majority of the issue. We just need to find the
keystore. [1] has a patch in it showing the code in the workaround. Do you
think this is something w could get in for Be?

Deployments that require SSL for OVSDB will probably want to have SSL for OpenFlow too. This means we will need to use same certificate for OVSDB as well as OF. So I?d say still makes sense to have certificates in AAA and different applications can register with AAA to access those.

I recognize there is a security gap by not providing common infrastructure
for key generation, storage and distribution, albeit this is something we
have lived with for Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium and now Beryllium releases.
This is definitely new functionality (and new APIs) which traditionally
should be added in a major release.  On the other hand, I understand there
is certainly a compelling security argument to port the change to
Beryllium, so I am amenable to a cherry pick if other community members
don't raise objection(s).  Transparency is key in this sort of situation.

I also feel as though I should reiterate *caveat emptor*;  the aaa-cert
functionality is still rudimentary.  There is no clustering support (this
is something on the AAA Boron release plan), and we do not currently have
integration testing for the feature (it is not ""stable"").  Thats not to say
its not good code;  but it is still in the inchoate phase of development.

Just to explain how the certificate base authentication work, we have 2
possible architectures

1- Selfsign PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private key
and certificate, then ODL will needs the certificate of each ovsdb-node to
be added to its keystore and the ovsdb-node can receive the ODL certificate
by allowing bootstrap in its SSL config

2- Hierarchical PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private
key and Certificate Signing Request CSR. Then the ODL's CSR should be
signed by a CA  (Certificate Authority or  Intermediate Certificate
Authority) based on your structure. after the CA sign the ODL's CSR and
generate the ODL's certificate, the ODL's certificate should be added to
the ODL keystore and the ovsdb-node's certificate should be also signed by
the same CA  allow mutual authentication.

What we have now in aaa-cert ? the aaa-cert bundle support the 2
architectures we just mentioned above. Once the aaa-cert feature installed,
ODL will have its private key, certificate, CSR and establish a TLS
connection for the openflow protocol ""based on openflowjava TLS
configuration"".

Ovsdb project can use aaa-cert to do :
1- add the ovsdb-node certificate to the trust keystore
2- generate a CSR and then add the signed certificate to the ODL keystore
(if using Hierarchical PKI)
3- receive the  keystores that required to establish the SSL connection.

What is missing ? as Ryan mentioned all certificates and ODL private key
are stored in a Java keystore file not in mdsal, so there is no cluster
support, there is no way now to exchange the keystore across the cluster
nodes.
We are Working on this issue and I will propose something soon but cannot
guarantee it will be ready within 2 weeks.

So Ovsdb may can support TLS but for a single ODL node or manage in someway
to have the kestores copied across the ODL cluster nodes. Also have to
notice that openflowjava have the same issue there is no support for
openflow TLS communication across cluster nodes.  Hope this help to clarify
the issue

Thanks

So after more investigation: multiple feature jobs are failing because of slow yang-parser and single feature jobs are failing because of what Vratko observed:


2016-03-16 05:10:33,396 | ERROR | config-pusher    | ConfigPusherImpl                 | 108 - org.opendaylight.controller.config-persister-impl - 0.4.1.Beryllium-SR1 | Failed to apply configuration snapshot: 00-netty.xml(odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-rest,odl-openflowplugin-flow-services-rest)

java.lang.SecurityException: Insufficient roles/credentials for operation

This could be related or not with the yang-parser issue.

Also to reproduce the above ERROR, you have to set the boot feature in the org.apache.kara.features.cfg, with feature:install the ERROR does not show and controller starts (still slow because of yang-parser issue).

BR/Luis

I think An cc'd to yangtools the wrong error. The one above is the one that should have been sent to yangtools. The other one that I see in many of the integration tests failures is:

Seems like it's auth related?

Adding aaa-dev to the list.

I'm not sure if the role checking goes thru AAA.

If the RBAC check failed, it seems that would mean an acl was changed in
the karaf distro. But then you would think verify builds would have failed.

Parser may hitted and reported OOM, but there is possibility it may not be the one that caused memory leak,
Memory snapshot would be really helpful to find culprit.

Default values for java options
seem to be defined in controller project.
I have contributed a change [0] to enable this.

Note that even if heap is dumped,
the suite has to download it from ODL_SYSTEM
(perhaps compressing it beforehand),
and job has to archive it
(currently only files matching ?*.log*? are archived).

To save space and time, only few jobs should perform
the download and archive steps.
(An -all- job, and perhaps some scale tests.)

?I agree to that, but hopefully it won't increase the build schedule time, because you will have to copy 2-3 gig of file from the VM before you release it to run next job.

?is there a possibility to have a SAN attached to all the VM's that we spawn to run the jobs? and we dump all the heapdumps in SAN rather then in the VM disk? that way we don't have to worry about copying it from VM. We can limit the SAN disk size says 300 gig atleast and after that we can probably keep deleting the old heapdumps.?

I have a problem installing NETCONF features in ODL, but I think, that it is connected to this AAA patch
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/36063/
I tried to revert before that patch and issue wasn't present.
When I try to run

""feature:install odl-netconf-mdsal odl-restconf-all""

it fails with following exception:

EnvironmentLoader                | 251 - org.apache.shiro.web - 1.2.4 | Shiro environment initialization failed

However ""feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-netconf-mdsal"" will complete successfully.

Do we need to somehow adapt our code in netconf project to be compatible with that patch?

In Beryllium-SR1, the you can enable debug on this class [1].  To enable
debug from karaf:

karaf> log:set DEBUG org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.TokenAuthRealm

The messaging is a bit vague, so it was improved in master
(Beryllium-SR2).  If you switch to that, there is an AuthenticationListener
impl [2] registered by default which reports this information at DEBUG
level.  In master, you can enable this logging by:

karaf> log:set DEBUG
org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.filters.AuthenticationListener

Hope this helps!

 odl-restconf installs odl-aaa-shiro, which does the file installation of

just had an IRC session with Ryan.  Looks like the root problem here is that
neutron (and gbp) is still depending on a deprecated aaa features (authn).
Ryan can give more gory details if anyone is interested, and he's giving
patches now.

In the end, putting restconf back in to our openstack feature was needed (so
the trouble would not have been seen), but we did end up finding two projects
to fix.

I have seen in your repository that you implement federated
authentication to OpenDaylight and many other features, but I'm unsure
if and equivalent module to password credentials for public key is
already available. In that case, I would try to use it from netconf
modules. Otherwise, is it on the roadmap?

Thank you for your time,

Currently it's not supported, that's why there is only the login-password case present in the model.
Bug to track this: https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5817
I don't want to make any commitments but we might be able to tackle this by the end of Boron if we have spare resources.

any idea on these system test failures?  Nothing stands out in karaf.log or
the actual test suite logs.  Looks like trouble with auth tokens.  Two
jobs with latest SR2 each had a single failure, though not the same failure:

https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/job/aaa-csit-1node-authn-only-beryllium/1248/robot/report/log.html
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/job/aaa-csit-1node-authn-only-beryllium/1253/robot/report/log.html

Both failures are same basic reason.  The suite gets a token and then
tries to use it when hitting /restconf/modules and expects a 200 status
code, but gets 401 instead.

There were no AAA CSIT failure in the previous SR2 distro.

My hunch is that something intermittent is there and probably has been there for some
time.  If we assume that, then we can say it's not a regression from SR1 and mark it
as non-blocking.

Somehow, these kinds of failures need to get cleaned up, whether it's something to fix
in test code, controller code, or environment.

new bug filed here:
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5838

this issue is seen in SR1, so it can't be considered a regression from something we've
already shipped.  It is intermittent, but not hard to reproduce locally with the same
robot suite we have running (and failing) in releng.

I cannot reproduce with Lithium SR2 (its what I had handy).


I ran the test 40 times for each of the 3 distros:

BeSR2 - 8  failures
BeSR1 - 11 failures
LiSR2 - 0  failures

still only spawn 1 controller. If you look at the job configuration:

Based on your feedback and JamO?s comments, we should mark this issue as OKAY to release in SR2.

However, I am concerned about the sporadic nature of this test failure, since it passed in Beryllium-SR2-Build-20160425 but failed in Beryllium-SR2-Build-20160430.  Hopefully in the next release SR3, we can either find the root cause or at least make the failure a little bit more deterministic?

Best Regards,
An Ho

more info:

new bug filed here:
https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5838

this issue is seen in SR1, so it can't be considered a regression from something we've
already shipped.  It is intermittent, but not hard to reproduce locally with the same
robot suite we have running (and failing) in releng.

I cannot reproduce with Lithium SR2 (its what I had handy).


I ran the test 40 times for each of the 3 distros:

BeSR2 - 8  failures
BeSR1 - 11 failures
LiSR2 - 0  failures


BTW, it's in the bug too, but this snippet is interesting from the karaf log

Dear Ryan

Thanks for the response. In our Controller Shield Project we are are creating a repository (database) of valid and invalid login attempts to ODL by checking the Karaf Log information. Right now we are able to get the time stamps of login attempts by enabling AAA plugin. We are also looking for source IP address of these attempts. Could we get this additional piece of information in the subsequent releases (Beryllium SR2) of AAA plugin.

We had sent you a mail regarding this early this year. It would be great if you could provide a notification for the login attempts (successful and failed) for applications like ours to consume, some time down the line.

I noticed the code on the TokenEndPoint is implemented via a different method of IdmLight, seems that the testing method is also different from what I know and did for TSDR. Should we disable this test until we can reimplement the TokenEndPoint like IdmLight end point?

I looked into it and wasn?t able to fix it.
Could you please chime in either to assist me to fix it, or to fix it?

I tried to pulled jetty-io and jetty-util but it didn?t really helped. jetty-util definitely moved the above errors away, but
then I got new one:

distribution, but this will require that all of the offset 0 projects be
mature [0] and complete the requirements for at least their core features
to be stable [1].

My strong suspicion is that all of these projects and core features already
meet the requirements to be mature and stable and so it's mostly a
(relatively lightweight) bookkeeping and paperwork exercise.

I'd really like to hear from the offset 0 PTLs if I'm wrong somewhere
though.

that you feel like the definition of what a feature has to do to be stable
isn't strong enough. Given that we've been at this for 3 years, have no
stable features and the dominant complaint we have is that the requirements
for a feature to be stable are too high, I'm just going to have to disagree
and say maybe we should either (a) have a stronger label for the form of
API stability you talk about or (b) increase the requirements to be stable
over time as we can more reasonably meet thme.

In terms of the definition of a feature, I *think* we specified it to be
the set of bundles that feature pulls in and that the features it pulls in
must also be stable. It probably needs to be refined a little bit to say
that it should transitively include the set of bundles it pulls in local to
this project. I'd be happy to work through what we think a reasonable
concrete definition was. My hope was that this would be something that
could be eyeballed (by the TSC) at the beginning and codified (or not) as
we gained experience.

In terms of longevity, runtime compatibility and ABI compatibility, I think
I'll come to the same point as I did on your first concern. Interesting
ideas, but I think not moving forward with some notion of stability because
we don't have these is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

- It is the job we use as the Integration team to discern the quality of release
  candidates.
- Can be used to test gerrit patches, using the ""test-integration"" keyword [1]

We also envision downstream consumers (e.g. OPNFV) being able to quickly check these
results when determining if they can consume a nightly distribution or if it may be
broken in some way.  This can be a valuable piece toward moving to faster release
cycles, as well.

In order to maximize the benefit of this job, we need all CSIT jobs running
there to adhere to our system test case expectations [2].

So, in the short term we have removed [3][4] all projects' (see list above
for affected projects) CSIT jobs that are not meeting these expectations.
Having CSIT jobs running there is a release requirement [5] in order to
avoid features being labeled as experimental, so although the current number
of CSIT jobs may be low in our Boron distribution test job, I expect that
projects will start to bring their CSIT jobs to a more reliable state and
then introduce them back (or for the first time) via this job .yaml [6]

Please reach out to the Integration team if you have any questions.

Thanks,
JamO

Bad things always happen, we can't assume it wouldn't happen. If
customers using a older version of AAA in their production, making the
bug fixing is too late.
The topic I want to discuss is about ""high-available"", may be ""escape""
is a way, may be ""cluster"" is another way.But I can't find these
features from the github repository except the Cassandra.
So, is there something that  I have missed about ""cluster"" ? or the
""AAA"" has make the ""cluser"" to running well? and what's the plan about
""cluster"" on the ""AAA"" project?

Checking back in on this one to make sure you aren't still experiencing
issues?  AAA service resolution is punted to a separate thread (a
ServiceTrackerCustomizer) that sometimes takes a little bit of time to come
up.  In the situation that RESTCONF loads prior to AAA, you will see 401.
That is simply because the service isn't yet available, and there is no way
to derive whether credentials are any good.  In this way, AAA is a
fail-closed system;  we do not want to let people in just because the
services haven't loaded.  Perhaps it would be more useful to report a 5XX
code during this time period?  I am sorry the messaging about this is
ambiguous.

There were plans to migrate to blueprint, but those fell off the radar thus
far.  We are still hoping to get this in sometime in the Boron timeframe.
What this means is that we could force a more deterministic ordering to
ensure AAA services are injected prior to RESTCONF.

Please let me know if you continue experiencing issues with AAA.  I am more
than happy to inspect jstack and karaf logs if so;  we have put in a bunch
of useful information to track AAA service injection state over the past
few releases to help track ""is it up"" for AAA anyway.  As far as I know
things should be working well on the AAA front.  Let me know if you find
otherwise!

Hello all,

I hope this isnt a very obvious/repeated question, but Im stuck with a Master/Boron distro that I built yesterday. Im trying to send restconf, with the typical admin/admin user/pass, but Im getting HTTP 401 responses.

Ive been digging around in the distro config and cant find where the user/pass is configured. But then I started thinking: I cant tell if this is due to a change in the user/pass, or perhaps AAA isnt working. I havent seen any strange errors in the logs, though.

Can somebody help me out here, please.

Subject: Re: [ovsdb-dev] TLS support and certificates

Hi ovsdb team,

Just to explain how the certificate base authentication work, we have 2 possible architectures

1- Selfsign PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private key and certificate, then ODL will needs the certificate of each ovsdb-node to be added to its keystore and the ovsdb-node can receive the ODL certificate by allowing bootstrap in its SSL config

2- Hierarchical PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private key and Certificate Signing Request CSR. Then the ODL's CSR should be signed by a CA  (Certificate Authority or  Intermediate Certificate Authority) based on your structure. after the CA sign the ODL's CSR and generate the ODL's certificate, the ODL's certificate should be added to the ODL keystore and the ovsdb-node's certificate should be also signed by the same CA  allow mutual authentication.

What we have now in aaa-cert ? the aaa-cert bundle support the 2 architectures we just mentioned above. Once the aaa-cert feature installed, ODL will have its private key, certificate, CSR and establish a TLS connection for the openflow protocol ""based on openflowjava TLS configuration"".

Ovsdb project can use aaa-cert to do :
1- add the ovsdb-node certificate to the trust keystore
2- generate a CSR and then add the signed certificate to the ODL keystore (if using Hierarchical PKI)
3- receive the  keystores that required to establish the SSL connection.

What is missing ? as Ryan mentioned all certificates and ODL private key are stored in a Java keystore file not in mdsal, so there is no cluster support, there is no way now to exchange the keystore across the cluster nodes.
We are Working on this issue and I will propose something soon but cannot guarantee it will be ready within 2 weeks.

So Ovsdb may can support TLS but for a single ODL node or manage in someway to have the kestores copied across the ODL cluster nodes. Also have to notice that openflowjava have the same issue there is no support for openflow TLS communication across cluster nodes.  Hope this help to clarify the issue

Thanks

Hi Anil,

Deployments that require SSL for OVSDB will probably want to have SSL for OpenFlow too. This means we will need to use same certificate for OVSDB as well as OF. So I?d say still makes sense to have certificates in AAA and different applications can register with AAA to access those.

Ryan, How in general certification access works ? Do user need to register the certificates per device and then southbound plugin can access the certificates through AAA? Or there is some other architecture need to be in place?

Just wondering if it make sense to have device specific certificates in AAA, because OVSDB devices will be accessed only through southbound plugin, so isn't it better to put them in southbound plugin itself? Until and unless we want to put restriction on who can access these certificates, that's where probably AAA comes to the picture, but in this case i don't see any scenario. Thoughts ?

Hi Vishal,

As for setting up SSL for OVSDB, I have never done it.  I don't know whether ODL's OVSDB currently supports setting up SSL/TLS... it has been about 6 months since I have looked at the southbound code.  Sam, any thoughts here?  I would have to imagine that you just place the keystore in a well known location if the functionality exists.  That said, I am not sure it was ever tackled...

Subject: Re: [ovsdb-dev] TLS support and certificates

Hi ovsdb team,

Just to explain how the certificate base authentication work, we have 2 possible architectures

1- Selfsign PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private key and certificate, then ODL will needs the certificate of each ovsdb-node to be added to its keystore and the ovsdb-node can receive the ODL certificate by allowing bootstrap in its SSL config

2- Hierarchical PKI for ODL: which mean the ODL will generate its private key and Certificate Signing Request CSR. Then the ODL's CSR should be signed by a CA  (Certificate Authority or  Intermediate Certificate Authority) based on your structure. after the CA sign the ODL's CSR and generate the ODL's certificate, the ODL's certificate should be added to the ODL keystore and the ovsdb-node's certificate should be also signed by the same CA  allow mutual authentication.

What we have now in aaa-cert ? the aaa-cert bundle support the 2 architectures we just mentioned above. Once the aaa-cert feature installed, ODL will have its private key, certificate, CSR and establish a TLS connection for the openflow protocol ""based on openflowjava TLS configuration"".

Ovsdb project can use aaa-cert to do :
1- add the ovsdb-node certificate to the trust keystore
2- generate a CSR and then add the signed certificate to the ODL keystore (if using Hierarchical PKI)
3- receive the  keystores that required to establish the SSL connection.

What is missing ? as Ryan mentioned all certificates and ODL private key are stored in a Java keystore file not in mdsal, so there is no cluster support, there is no way now to exchange the keystore across the cluster nodes.
We are Working on this issue and I will propose something soon but cannot guarantee it will be ready within 2 weeks.

So Ovsdb may can support TLS but for a single ODL node or manage in someway to have the kestores copied across the ODL cluster nodes. Also have to notice that openflowjava have the same issue there is no support for openflow TLS communication across cluster nodes.  Hope this help to clarify the issue

Thanks

That was my thinking also - the certificate would likely be shared across different apps and the use cases would likely have multiple apps needing the certificates.
I could still see some app-specific configuration like enabling or disable ssl/tls.

Hi Anil,

Deployments that require SSL for OVSDB will probably want to have SSL for OpenFlow too. This means we will need to use same certificate for OVSDB as well as OF. So I?d say still makes sense to have certificates in AAA and different applications can register with AAA to access those.

Unfortunately there is no wiki for how to use this AAA-Cert API yet, but if
you looking a guiding the AAA-Cli [1] bundle is a good example. also the
patch I mentioned before should go in review this week, once it is merged I
will create a wiki page on how to use the aaa-cert APIs.

Good questions.  AAA is implemented as a set of OSGi services, and is local
per node.  The default TokenAuthRealm is *not* cluster aware in the default
implementation, though I would like to see that change (would be a good
place to utilize new EOS APIs Vaclav and Robert have been working on).  The
backing data store is based on a simple H2 SQL implementation (file based),
and is distinct per node.  Each node has its own set of database
credentials, which must be synchronized using out of band means.  This
isn't a great design, but it has provided necessary functionality so far.
It is suggested to use The ODLJndiLdapRealm for clustered scenarios, which
essentially punts auth decisions to an external LDAP server.

And does it support high-availability?


If the AAA service fails on a particular node, that node is hosed.  The
other two nodes are still usable.  This has been sufficient thus far, but
we really ought to re-examine this in Carbon.

AAA contribution has been fairly low over the past release unfortunately,
so this is our unfortunate status quo.  As I said before, my motivation is
somewhat limited since we recommend to use LDAP for clustered scenarios.
That said, if you or others have cycles to contribute, I can certainly
provide assistance.

Hope this helps!

Hi Ryan,

I have a question about the AAA module in ODL - is it cluster-aware? And does it support high-availability? Under high-availability I mean - is there a single ""active"" instance of the AAA service in the cluster, which can move to another node if its original node fails? How are the failover handled, and how is the HA of the AA database handled?



Thanks in advance,
Jan

Basic REST API level change of admin password worked fine.

My clarifications around shiro was mainly on how to enable integration with any existing auth infra  (eg. already existing LDAP or better yet Openstack Keystone) in typical customer deployments.

Hi Muthu,
1.      Can I configure these values in statically in shiro.ini or should the values be changed elsewhere ?
These are currently stored per node in a file based database (idmlight.db.mv.db).  You can manipulate the credentials using the utility script called idmtool (which is installed to the etc folder upon feature installation).

2.      In order to use shiro.ini , is odl-restconf-all feature alone is sufficient  or any other additional features to be installed ?

Yes, odl-restconf automatically installs the odl-aaa-shiro feature.  That is all that is needed.

3.      In distro ZIP I am not able to find shiro.ini etc folder. Does this get placed at etc folder only when we bring up controller at least once and/or only when required features are installed ?

Upon feature installation.  If AAA is not needed, the file doesn't need to be installed.  It was also quite a bit easier than doing the artifact copy at built time in the integration/distribution project.

I'm working with the OPNFV Release Manager (David, CC'd) and
the OPNFV Moon project PTL (Ruan, CC'd) to upstream their fork
of OpenDaylight AAA.

They have a copy of AAA's repo, based off of Beryllium SR2, in
their OPNFV repo. They would like to get their changes proposed
against the upstream AAA repo, and eventually merged into AAA.

https://git.opnfv.org/cgit/moon/tree/odl-aaa-moon

I guess the first step is to rebase their changes into AAA. I
can imagine a number of mechanical ways to do that, but in general
we'd figure out what changes they made to AAA (git log/format-patch),
copy those changes into AAA's upstream repo and push a new Gerrit
to start the review discussion.

Ruan isn't experienced with contributing to upstream communities,
so I would really appreciate help to make this minimally painful.

Who wants to do the git-foo to create a Gerrit from their changes?

First of all, thanks for the introduction to some of the OPNFV guys!  AAA
team appreciates contribution from all contributors, and I am glad to see
other organizations are looking through our code base.  That said I do have
a few things that I'd like to state in the friendliest way possible:

1) This is essentially a fork right now, which is expressly discouraged by
EPL;  it lives separate from the rest of the AAA development process.
2) Large changes are often difficult and time consuming to review and merge
conflicts can be hard to resolve over time.

These things aren't insurmountable, and I am sure we can get through them.
Ruan, do you have a high level description of the changes that you made?
This would be super helpful to determine which functionality is affected.

My recommendation is for Ruan to move his changes into a branch based off
*master* and to add myself, Sharon Aichler and Mohamed El'Serngawy to the
review.  Since new functionality is reserved for major releases, it is
easiest to get this into the Boron stream.  If Ruan needs a bit of help
porting the code, I am more than happy to try to provide assistance.

Thanks,

-          A new Moon AuthN Realm for token

-          An authenticator that redirects authentication request to OpenStack/Keystone-moon and returns the UUID of the user in OpenStack.

Hi Daniel & Ruan,

First of all, thanks for the introduction to some of the OPNFV guys!  AAA team appreciates contribution from all contributors, and I am glad to see other organizations are looking through our code base.  That said I do have a few things that I'd like to state in the friendliest way possible:

1) This is essentially a fork right now, which is expressly discouraged by EPL;  it lives separate from the rest of the AAA development process.
2) Large changes are often difficult and time consuming to review and merge conflicts can be hard to resolve over time.

These things aren't insurmountable, and I am sure we can get through them.  Ruan, do you have a high level description of the changes that you made?  This would be super helpful to determine which functionality is affected.

My recommendation is for Ruan to move his changes into a branch based off master and to add myself, Sharon Aichler and Mohamed El'Serngawy to the review.  Since new functionality is reserved for major releases, it is easiest to get this into the Boron stream.  If Ruan needs a bit of help porting the code, I am more than happy to try to provide assistance.

Thanks,

Ryan Goulding

Hello AAA,

I'm working with the OPNFV Release Manager (David, CC'd) and
the OPNFV Moon project PTL (Ruan, CC'd) to upstream their fork
of OpenDaylight AAA.

They have a copy of AAA's repo, based off of Beryllium SR2, in
their OPNFV repo. They would like to get their changes proposed
against the upstream AAA repo, and eventually merged into AAA.

https://git.opnfv.org/cgit/moon/tree/odl-aaa-moon

I guess the first step is to rebase their changes into AAA. I
can imagine a number of mechanical ways to do that, but in general
we'd figure out what changes they made to AAA (git log/format-patch),
copy those changes into AAA's upstream repo and push a new Gerrit
to start the review discussion.

Ruan isn't experienced with contributing to upstream communities,
so I would really appreciate help to make this minimally painful.

Who wants to do the git-foo to create a Gerrit from their changes?

Looks like they implemented a custom AuthenticatingFilter and Realm (shiro
APIs), which is a good approach for our architecture.  You likely enable it
through shiro.ini, and I imagine the AuthenticatingFilter is auto-chained
within the shiro context.  Agreed, documentation in form of a wiki article
would be super useful.

I remember recommending a similar approach a while back to one of Ruan's
colleagues, Alioune, but hadn't heard back in a while.  Glad to see this
coming to fruition.

Thanks to all involved.

I believe that was greenfield work that never came to fruition;  I could be
wrong though since that was before my time.  The odl-aaa-keystone feature
was just an empty Activator and supporting poms removed with this commit
[1].

The approach these folks have taken is to design a custom Shiro Realm for
interacting with OpenStack.  This is what we recommend, since Realms are
pluggable and modular by design.

OPNFV is primarily about integration, deployment, and test.  Although some
projects generate new code, most projects generate changes to upstream
components in order to fill gaps or to measure or improve performance.

The OPNFV release vehicle is what we call a ""scenario"", which is more or
less a use case made up of an installer, a set of components, and a
configuration.  Scenarios have installation guides and other documentation
that describe how to setup and deploy the scenario.  Scenarios also have a
set of test cases implemented using the OPNFV test frameworks FuncTest and
Yardstick that run as part of CI.

ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=People,dc=*DOMAIN*,dc=*TLD*

replacing only the *bolded* parts with the values appropriate for your

For example:

This has worked very successfully for me in the past for OpenLDAP
deployments.  Which IdP are you using?

There is no People organization ""ou=People"" in my LDAP setup so I guess it
will not gonna work also the uid is different.
I'm using OpenLDAP with ubuntu environment following [1] to setup. is there
a specific OpenLdap version should I use?

nominating myself for Carbon AAA PTL.  If others are interested, I
encourage you to self-nominate on this thread.  Are any other committers

I will schedule time for us to discuss this during our next weekly meeting

self-nominate, we will start the formal vote following the meeting.

Thanks very much,

Thanks a lot for your reply, since we are new in this community, this issue becomes an important lesson for us!! Our future contribution will strictly follow your recommendation!!
My colleague, Alioune BA, has contacted you previously for the Moon/OPNFV project. Our objective is to delegate ODL?s authentication to OpenStack/Keystone, which enables unique identification for OPNFV. As you can see in the figure prepared by Alioune, the main changes that we have made for AAA are:

-          A new filter in Shiro

-          A new Moon AuthN Realm for token

-          An authenticator that redirects authentication request to OpenStack/Keystone-moon and returns the UUID of the user in OpenStack.

Hi Daniel & Ruan,

First of all, thanks for the introduction to some of the OPNFV guys!  AAA team appreciates contribution from all contributors, and I am glad to see other organizations are looking through our code base.  That said I do have a few things that I'd like to state in the friendliest way possible:

1) This is essentially a fork right now, which is expressly discouraged by EPL;  it lives separate from the rest of the AAA development process.
2) Large changes are often difficult and time consuming to review and merge conflicts can be hard to resolve over time.

These things aren't insurmountable, and I am sure we can get through them.  Ruan, do you have a high level description of the changes that you made?  This would be super helpful to determine which functionality is affected.

My recommendation is for Ruan to move his changes into a branch based off master and to add myself, Sharon Aichler and Mohamed El'Serngawy to the review.  Since new functionality is reserved for major releases, it is easiest to get this into the Boron stream.  If Ruan needs a bit of help porting the code, I am more than happy to try to provide assistance.

Thanks,

Ryan Goulding

Hello AAA,

I'm working with the OPNFV Release Manager (David, CC'd) and
the OPNFV Moon project PTL (Ruan, CC'd) to upstream their fork
of OpenDaylight AAA.

They have a copy of AAA's repo, based off of Beryllium SR2, in
their OPNFV repo. They would like to get their changes proposed
against the upstream AAA repo, and eventually merged into AAA.

https://git.opnfv.org/cgit/moon/tree/odl-aaa-moon

I guess the first step is to rebase their changes into AAA. I
can imagine a number of mechanical ways to do that, but in general
we'd figure out what changes they made to AAA (git log/format-patch),
copy those changes into AAA's upstream repo and push a new Gerrit
to start the review discussion.

Ruan isn't experienced with contributing to upstream communities,
so I would really appreciate help to make this minimally painful.

Who wants to do the git-foo to create a Gerrit from their changes?

upstream CSIT for boron, using the most recent boron job result.

please note that I do not know if all delivered features have system test or not, so
only reporting on what exists.


OK        aaa-csit-1node-authn-all-boron    (intermittent failure due to ssh test infra issue)
OK        aaa-csit-1node-authn-only-boron   (well known bug 5838 cause intermittent failures)

NOT-OK    aaa-csit-1node-idmlite-only-boron (unexpected failures)
NOT-OK    aaa-csit-1node-idmlite-all-boron  (unexpected failures)

With these results, I think any idmlite related feature would be experimental.  Authn features
are ok.  All other AAA features delivered in Boron would also be experimental.

Hi Team,

Hi Team,

I am emailing to call for nominations for AAA Carbon PTL.  I am also nominating myself for Carbon AAA PTL.  If others are interested, I encourage you to self-nominate on this thread.  Are any other committers interested in running?

I will schedule time for us to discuss this during our next weekly meeting (8/25/2016), and if we feel that everyone has had an adequate chance to self-nominate, we will start the formal vote following the meeting.

Thanks very much,

Ryan

I mentioned before that as a community, we really don't like to add new
functionality in service releases unless it is a bug fix or security fix.
That said, this may be classified as a security enhancement, and thus fit
under the category of acceptable changes.  Please initially target the
master branch, and then we can pose the question to the team about whether
we should pull it back into stable/boron.  While I don't see any problem
with it personally, I strive to promote transparency with all stakeholders
involved.

I have been using token bearer authorization for my RESTconf  and see that

though the cache lists the correct number of tokens (10 in this case). Has
this been seen previously? I'm running beryllium-sr3

Hi Ryan
When you say ""race condition"", what are the subjects involved? I verified
that the token for which restconf throws 401 is indeed showing up in the
cache. Whenever an user attempts to authorize over restconf, which entity
does the check in the cache? Or is there a different internal cache besides
the mdsal tokencache?

Thanks
Srini.

That method doesn't work well anymore since passwords are now encrypted.
Thus, you would need to pass the encrypted value to the update command.

Hi Rayan and Team,

I  am using beryllium version of ODL. I am trying to create a new user and  want to give permissions to that new user. But before that I tried to change password of admin
just to ensure AAA service setup I have properly done or not.

Now I have used following steps to create new user:
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3.  opened rest conf documentation using  http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/aaa-authn-model(2014-10-29)/PUT_authentication_put_22  by admin/admin
(username and passsword).
4. used aaa-authn-model module
5. put request to authentication container i.e /config/aaa-authn-model:authentication/
6. now I put following JSON :

{""authentication"":{
? ""role"": [
??? {
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",
????? ""description"": ""nisha admin"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ],
? ""domain"": [
??? {
????? ""name"": ""sdn"",
????? ""description"": ""sdn domain"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn"",
????? ""enabled"": ""true""
??? }
? ],
? ""grant"": [
??? {
????? ""grantid"": ""nisha at sdn@nisha at admin@sdn"",
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""userid"": ""nisha at sdn"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ],
? ""user"": [
??? {
????? ""password"": ""nisha"",
????? ""salt"": ""no"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",
????? ""description"": ""nisha admin"",
????? ""userid"": ""nisha at sdn"",
????? ""enabled"": ""true"",
????? ""email"": ""vnisha45 at gmail.com"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ]
}}
but  its not working for me when again I tried to open apidoc/Rest web page  using nisha/nisha(username and password), but its again able to logged in using admin/admin.


For changing password of admin user I tried following steps :
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3. at karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
4. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : cat user.json 
contents of user.json file which I put in local karaf/target/assembly/bin? is :
{
""name"":""admin"",
""description"":""admin account"",
""enabled"":""true"",
""email"":"""",
""password"":""newadminpassword""
}
5. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command
?: curl -u admin:admin -X PUT -H ""Content-Type: application/json""  --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/admin at sdn

but again its not working for me.

Please provide me proper steps to create new user and grant permissions i.e admin/user roles and also password change for admin.

Now after performing above steps.I again tried to login ODL apidoc/REST web page(after removing all previous browser cookie) , but still I am only able to get login by
using default username and password i.e admin and admin respectively.I have also tried to see database table for users by using following query :
1. idmlight.db=> select * from USERS;
but the changes is not getting reflected in table also.

Then I tried 2nd method i.e?Change password when odl is not running :
by directly updating the table using following query :
2. idmlight.db=> update USERS set password='newadminpassword' where userid=admin at sdn;

but still unable to login using updated password.

Please help regarding this issue and suggest If I am missing any steps.

upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to

1. idmlight.db=> select * from USERS;
but the changes is not getting reflected in table also.

Then I tried 2nd method i.e?Change password when odl is not running :
by directly updating the table using following query :
2. idmlight.db=> update USERS set password='newadminpassword' where userid=admin at sdn;

but still unable to login using updated password.

Please help regarding this issue and suggest If I am missing any steps.

Subject: Re: Issue while changing account passwords in ODL using AAA feature

Hi Nisha,

Were you able to locate the idmtool script?

To add a bit of background info, the md-sal model is disabled by default mainly because it was subject to some unexpectedly long waits (almost deadlock like) scenarios in terms of bundle loading.? We have since upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to investigate this approach again in Carbon.? One other reason is that, while the passwords were encrypted, some of the other identity information was presented in plain text through RESTCONF, which is a security concern for many people.

HTH!

I  am using beryllium version of ODL. I am trying to create a new user and  want to give permissions to that new user. But before that I tried to change password of admin
just to ensure AAA service setup I have properly done or not.

Now I have used following steps to create new user:
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3.  opened rest conf documentation using  http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/aaa-authn-model(2014-10-29)/PUT_authentication_put_22  by admin/admin
(username and passsword).
4. used aaa-authn-model module
5. put request to authentication container i.e /config/aaa-authn-model:authentication/
6. now I put following JSON :

{""authentication"":{
? ""role"": [
??? {
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",
????? ""description"": ""nisha admin"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""

but  its not working for me when again I tried to open apidoc/Rest web page  using nisha/nisha(username and password), but its again able to logged in using admin/admin.


For changing password of admin user I tried following steps :
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3. at karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
4. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : cat user.json 
contents of user.json file which I put in local karaf/target/assembly/bin? is :
{
""name"":""admin"",
""description"":""admin account"",
""enabled"":""true"",
""email"":"""",
""password"":""newadminpassword""

5. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command

Then I tried 2nd method i.e?Change password when odl is not running :
by directly updating the table using following query :
2. idmlight.db=> update USERS set password='newadminpassword' where userid=admin at sdn;

but still unable to login using updated password.

Please help regarding this issue and suggest If I am missing any steps.

Subject: Re: Issue while changing account passwords in ODL using AAA feature

Hi Nisha,

Were you able to locate the idmtool script?

To add a bit of background info, the md-sal model is disabled by default mainly because it was subject to some unexpectedly long waits (almost deadlock like) scenarios in terms of bundle loading.? We have since upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to investigate this approach again in Carbon.? One other reason is that, while the passwords were encrypted, some of the other identity information was presented in plain text through RESTCONF, which is a security concern for many people.

HTH!

Hi Rayan and Team,

First of all thanks alot for your support and reply.

I  am using beryllium version of ODL. I am trying to create a new user and  want to give permissions to that new user. But before that I tried to change password of admin
just to ensure AAA service setup I have properly done or not.

Now I have used following steps to create new user:
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3.  opened rest conf documentation using  http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/aaa-authn-model(2014-10-29)/PUT_authentication_put_22  by admin/admin
(username and passsword).
4. used aaa-authn-model module
5. put request to authentication container i.e /config/aaa-authn-model:authentication/
6. now I put following JSON :

{""authentication"":{
? ""role"": [
??? {
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",
????? ""description"": ""nisha admin"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""

? ""grant"": [

????? ""userid"": ""nisha at sdn"",
????? ""enabled"": ""true"",
????? ""email"": ""vnisha45 at gmail.com"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ]
}}
but  its not working for me when again I tried to open apidoc/Rest web page  using nisha/nisha(username and password), but its again able to logged in using admin/admin.


For changing password of admin user I tried following steps :
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3. at karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
4. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : cat user.json 
contents of user.json file which I put in local karaf/target/assembly/bin? is :
{
""name"":""admin"",
""description"":""admin account"",
""enabled"":""true"",
""email"":"""",
""password"":""newadminpassword""
}
5. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command
?: curl -u admin:admin -X PUT -H ""Content-Type: application/json""  --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/admin at sdn

but again its not working for me.

Please provide me proper/simple steps to create new user and grant permissions i.e admin/user roles and also password change for admin.

Hi Alioune,

I would suggest to set the format of moonAuthRealm.moonServerURL in shiro.ini like http://<address>:<port<http://%3caddress%3e:%3cport>> because <address>:<port> leads to te error below at the install of odl-aaa-shiro
This is a fix we can definitely get in;  thanks for the feedback.  I will form a patch to modify the shiro.ini file tomorrow, as it is past 8 p.m. my local time now :).


After shutting down the karaf container and then running ""rm -rf data/ snapshots/ journal/ etc/shiro.ini"", I observed that the modified shiro.ini is not loaded in karaf/target/assembly/etc/ Is it the expected behavior ?

Yes, the shiro.ini file is loaded upon feature install.  If etc/shiro.ini does not exist, it is replaced by the default one (the one we modified in source).  If you want to keep the existing shiro.ini, just dont delete it (we don't overwrite by default).  When I tested your patch, I kept a copy in my home directory and copied it in as needed.

 I've successfully tested the patch [1] with OPNFV/moon with the above suggestion.

Awesome, thanks for your hard work and persistence!  We hope you will remain active as a contributor to the AAA project;  great work on your first contribution! I extend kind thanks to Ruan, and the rest of the OPNFV team involved on creating this patch;  lets hope this is not the only instance where we can form some project synergy :).

Kind Regards,

Ryan

hi all,

I would suggest to set the format of moonAuthRealm.moonServerURL in shiro.ini like http://<address>:<port<http://%3caddress%3e:%3cport>> because <address>:<port> leads to te error below at the install of odl-aaa-shiro

After shutting down the karaf container and then running ""rm -rf data/ snapshots/ journal/ etc/shiro.ini"", I observed that the modified shiro.ini is not loaded in karaf/target/assembly/etc/ Is it the expected behavior ?

I've successfully tested the patch [1] with OPNFV/moon with the above suggestion.

I am working on couple of requirements that need me to use\customize AAA.
I was going through the aaa documentation (ODL) and also apache shiro
documentation.

I have a question regarding shiro AuthenticationListener..

1. If I would like to add a custom AuthenticationListener, similar to the
one org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.filters.AuthenticationListener for logging
purpose, how do i get my custom class into the classpath? the way I see
feat7res-restconf  depends on features-aaa-shiro. I want to add another
bundle, but how do I get this recognized by shiro.ini?


Thanks
hari

Is this something you are planning to add upstream?  If so, then you can
just put it in the  aaa-shiro bundle [1].

Otherwise, I suspect you would need to dynamically import the package for
use.

Hope this helps!

Regards,

Ryan Goulding

the aaa-shiro and bundle it with the product i am working on, we are using
BE SR3.

I got one observation. are we caching the credentials somewhere? after a
successful login, it looks like the ""Authorization"" header is not required
or even if it contains wrong data, it didn't stop the RPCs to fail. is this
expected? after couple of minutes or so I start getting 401 error though.

Thanks
Hari

I could execute the AAA Test plan and also went through the code
(AAAFilter, DomainHandler, RoleHandler, UserHandler.

Also looking at shiro documentation, i see, the following working fine.

Subject currentUser = SecurityUtils.getSubject(); LOG.info(""user
credentials {}, {}"", currentUser.getPrincipal());

 if (currentUser.hasRole(?administrator?)) {

    //let him continue?

} else {

    //if restricted api call, stop here.

}

So for my custom modules and RPCs, I can control it but not for the
restconf. How can I control the CRUD operations through restconf for my
modules? is there a way I can configure or implement it within AAA and push
the changes?

basically I want to apply authorization based on user role and URL patterns.

what should be my starting point?


Thanks
Hari

check the URL section at shiro.ini file at [1].

This leads to more questions from me (sorry abt that)

1.
is there any significance for ""domains"",  roles seems to be global and are
assigned to users (though the granting needs domainid, roleid, userid, i
didn't see domain significance on what it is supposed to achieve). can we
control at granular level using ""domains""?

2.
like to see multi tenancy within SDN and the users even though belong have
same role, cannt see data of other tenant.

3.
Also as I understand the configuration itself (URLs mapping with roles) is
static as of now and cannt be controlled programmatically. is this correct?


Thanks

Subject: Re: Issue while changing account passwords in ODL using AAA feature

Hi Nisha,

Were you able to locate the idmtool script?

To add a bit of background info, the md-sal model is disabled by default mainly because it was subject to some unexpectedly long waits (almost deadlock like) scenarios in terms of bundle loading.? We have since upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to investigate this approach again in Carbon.? One other reason is that, while the passwords were encrypted, some of the other identity information was presented in plain text through RESTCONF, which is a security concern for many people.

HTH!

Hi Rayan and Team,

First of all thanks alot for your support and reply.

I  am using beryllium version of ODL. I am trying to create a new user and  want to give permissions to that new user. But before that I tried to change password of admin
just to ensure AAA service setup I have properly done or not.

Now I have used following steps to create new user:
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3.  opened rest conf documentation using  http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/aaa-authn-model(2014-10-29)/PUT_authentication_put_22  by admin/admin
(username and passsword).
4. used aaa-authn-model module
5. put request to authentication container i.e /config/aaa-authn-model:authentication/
6. now I put following JSON :

{""authentication"":{
? ""role"": [
??? {
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",
????? ""description"": ""nisha admin"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ],
? ""domain"": [
??? {
????? ""name"": ""sdn"",
????? ""description"": ""sdn domain"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn"",
????? ""enabled"": ""true""

? ],
? ""grant"": [
??? {
????? ""grantid"": ""nisha at sdn@nisha at admin@sdn"",
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""userid"": ""nisha at sdn"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""

????? ""userid"": ""nisha at sdn"",
????? ""enabled"": ""true"",
????? ""email"": ""vnisha45 at gmail.com"",
????? ""domainid"": ""sdn""
??? }
? ]
}}
but  its not working for me when again I tried to open apidoc/Rest web page  using nisha/nisha(username and password), but its again able to logged in using admin/admin.


For changing password of admin user I tried following steps :
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3. at karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
4. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : cat user.json 
contents of user.json file which I put in local karaf/target/assembly/bin? is :
{
""name"":""admin"",
""description"":""admin account"",
""enabled"":""true"",
""email"":"""",
""password"":""newadminpassword""
}
5. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command
?: curl -u admin:admin -X PUT -H ""Content-Type: application/json""  --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/admin at sdn

but again its not working for me.

Hi Ryan/Team,

I am using LDAP which is not supporting anonymous connection.I need to connect LDAP using User+Password level security.
So I need to give UserDN and Password.But in case of etc/shiro.ini configurations we need to give following :

#ldapRealm = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.ODLJndiLdapRealm
#ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=People,dc=DOMAIN,dc=TLD
#ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://<URL>:389
#ldapRealm.searchBase = dc=DOMAIN,dc=TLD
# Abstraction to map LDAP extracted groups to ODL roles
#ldapRealm.groupRolesMap = ""person"":""admin"", ""organizationalPerson"":""user""
#ldapRealm.ldapAttributeForComparison = objectClass

also we need to enable LDAP using 

securityManager.realms = $ldapRealm

But where should I give password as their is no any password field provided in shiro.ini configuration file.

currently my shiro.ini is looking like this :

ldapRealm = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.ODLJndiLdapRealm
ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={},CN=Verma Nisha 69093860,OU=India,OU=Users,OU=UserAccounts,DC=nsn-intra,DC=net
ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://<LDAP URL> :389
ldapRealm.searchBase = DC=nsn-intra,DC=net

securityManager.realms = $ldapRealm


Kindly help me on this.

Hi Nisha,

Were you able to locate the idmtool script?

To add a bit of background info, the md-sal model is disabled by default mainly because it was subject to some unexpectedly long waits (almost deadlock like) scenarios in terms of bundle loading.? We have since upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to investigate this approach again in Carbon.? One other reason is that, while the passwords were encrypted, some of the other identity information was presented in plain text through RESTCONF, which is a security concern for many people.

Hi Nisha,

Could you give more details on how you use ODL ?. You mentioned you are using restconf to login, so by default when you install the restconf it will install odl-aaa-shiro feature which is using h2 as datastore.
Then you installed?odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster feature, this will use the mdsal as datastore for users data. Please provide more info, what are the steps you did ? and the version you use ?

3. curl -u admin:admin http://localh/json"" --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/admin at sdn

Now after performing above steps.I again tried to login ODL apidoc/REST web page(after removing all previous browser cookie) , but still I am only able to get login by
using default username and password i.e admin and admin respectively.I have also tried to see database table for users by using following query :
1. idmlight.db=> select * from USERS;
but the changes is not getting reflected in table also.

Then I tried 2nd method i.e?Change password when odl is not running :
by directly updating the table using following query :
2. idmlight.db=> update USERS set password='newadminpassword' where userid=admin at sdn;

but still unable to login using updated password.

Please help regarding this issue and suggest If I am missing any steps.

2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3. at karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
4. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command : cat user.json 
contents of user.json file which I put in local karaf/target/assembly/bin? is :
{
""name"":""admin"",
""description"":""admin account"",
""enabled"":""true"",
""email"":"""",
""password"":""newadminpassword""
}
5. At karaf/target/assembly/bin terminal I have put command
?: curl -u admin:admin -X PUT -H ""Content-Type: application/json""  --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users/admin at sdn

but again its not working for me.

Please provide me proper/simple steps to create new user and grant permissions i.e admin/user roles and also password change for admin.

Subject: #PERSONAL#Re: Re: Issue while changing account passwords in ODL using AAA feature

Hi Ryan/Team,

I am not using OpenLDAP, I am using commercial LDAP ,then how can I configure it?
Also provide me what I have to add in the following 2 configuration lines :

ldapRealm.groupRolesMap = ""person"":""admin"", ""organizationalPerson"":""user""
ldapRealm.ldapAttributeForComparison = objectClass

what will be objectClass here?
Is it necessary to pass values in these 2 parameters or it will work only by using following :

ldapRealm = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.ODLJndiLdapRealm
ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0}, CN=Verma Nisha 69093860,OU=India,OU=Users,OU=UserAccounts,DC=nsn-intra,DC=net
ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://<LDAP_URL>:389
ldapRealm.searchBase = ""DC=nsn-intra,DC=net""
ldapRealm.groupRolesMap = ""niverma"":""admin"", ""niverma"":""user""

By using above configuration ,I have seen karaf.log file and its showing following log :

2016-10-24 16:54:26,547 | INFO? | qtp564352524-137 | ODLJndiLdapRealm???????????????? | 223 - org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro - 0.3.4.SNAPSHOT | AAA LDAP connection from niverma

Does this mean is it connected to LDAP?
If yes, then we are still unable to log in ""localhost:8181/index.html#/login"" (ODL)

Hi Nisha,

You don't need to give a password, the configuration you have should work. If you are using OpenLDAP so you might need to make?ldapRealm.userDnTemplate something like that ""ldapRealm.userDnTemplate= cn{0},ou=users,dc=odl, dc=ldap,dc=org"" ?skip the uid{}. It should match the LDAP user identity.

Thanks

All of this is included in the upstream documentation [0].? Shiro based LDAP is configured through etc/shiro.ini (the actual file explains how to enable it as well).? LDAP can also be implemented using federation with an Apache HTTP server [1].? I prefer the first approach since there is less overhead in avoiding running a separate apache instance, but both should work.

Hope this helps!

Subject: Re: Issue while changing account passwords in ODL using AAA feature

Hi Nisha,

Were you able to locate the idmtool script?

To add a bit of background info, the md-sal model is disabled by default mainly because it was subject to some unexpectedly long waits (almost deadlock like) scenarios in terms of bundle loading.? We have since upgraded our DI framework to use Aries Blueprint, and may want to investigate this approach again in Carbon.? One other reason is that, while the passwords were encrypted, some of the other identity information was presented in plain text through RESTCONF, which is a security concern for many people.

HTH!

Now I have used following steps to create new user:
1. ./karaf clean
2. feature:install odl-restconf-all odl-aaa-shiro? odl-aaa-authn-mdsal-cluster
3.  opened rest conf documentation using  http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/aaa-authn-model(2014-10-29)/PUT_authentication_put_22  by admin/admin
(username and passsword).
4. used aaa-authn-model module
5. put request to authentication container i.e /config/aaa-authn-model:authentication/
6. now I put following JSON :

{""authentication"":{
? ""role"": [
??? {
????? ""roleid"": ""admin at sdn"",
????? ""name"": ""nisha"",

could you please advice me on this issue?

I was trying to add my authentication listener programmatically and able to
do it but problem is that I need to do it from a user context (through RPC
call).

here is the snippet

        org.apache.shiro.mgt.SecurityManager secManager = SecurityUtils.
getSecurityManager();
        AuthenticatingSecurityManager absSecMgr = (
AuthenticatingSecurityManager)secManager;
        AbstractAuthenticator absAuthenticator = (AbstractAuthenticator)
absSecMgr.getAuthenticator();
        absAuthenticator.getAuthenticationListeners().add(new
CustomAuthenticationListener());


Though, it(SecurityUtils.getSecurityManager()) is supposed to work without
user context, it is not working that way.

I know by adding my class within aaa-shiro, I can just use shiro.ini and my
work is done, but we are not yet moved to latest ODL (beryllium SR3 is what
we are using still).

So trying to find a way to get handle on it. any suggestions?

Brian responded the following code should work without user context but it
is not working that way, not sure if I am missing anything specific or
anything related to odl aaa feature.

Subject: Re: Question about SecurityManager /AuthenticationFilter
To: user at shiro.apache.org


Hi Brian,

I wanted to add my custom AuthenticationListener to shiro so that I can
required logging. As I understand I can get the SecurityManager reference
only during user context (RPC in ODL), I am doing this during a RPC
invocation.

        org.apache.shiro.mgt.SecurityManager secManager = SecurityUtils.
getSecurityManager();
        AuthenticatingSecurityManager absSecMgr = (
AuthenticatingSecurityManager)secManager;
        AbstractAuthenticator absAuthenticator = (AbstractAuthenticator)
absSecMgr.getAuthenticator();
        absAuthenticator.getAuthenticationListeners().add(new
XceedAuthenticationListener());


It doesn't sound right to me as multiple calls will result in duplicate
listeners. is there any easier option.

Since ODL AAA is initializing shiro, other option I have is to bundle my
code along with AAA but I want to avoid that.

Thanks
Hari

I quickly realized the limitations of Java ManagedService(s);  if the

defaults (so as to not block).  However, with database creation you
probably DO want to block if the file isn't present, since then you will
initialize the database with values that really aren't desired.  Thus, I
need to look into the clustered app config that Tom Pantelis wrote, as it
has a more robust way of handling this type of scenario.

We had spoke about this a couple times over IRC, and I think Michael wants to start looking into the work required to make this happen.  To recap there should be a way on the localhost running ODL to configure username/passwords/roles without using REST or knowing the admin password.  I think we can directly configure the database for most values, except for passwords - which you mentioned were salted.  So from my perspective this is one way to solve it:

1.  Make the java code which salts the passwords a runnable jar.
2.  Modify idmtool to allow direct configuration of the local DB, and have it call #1 when passwords are created/modified.

Thoughts?  Here is the AAA user/pw guide wiki:

through the (already merged) https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/48186/,

System.out in Karaf commands, as that change does..

See FYI https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/43973/ for an older Gerrit
in netvirt about this - and how to replace it with
session.getConsole().println() instead.

BTW: If you would like this problem to be automatically caught and fail
Gerrits, perhaps you would be motivated to enable Checkstyle enforcement in
AAA? Full documentation is available on

seeing this https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev/status/800752571497545729
prompts me to dare ask you guys here something that I had at the back of my
mind since jumping fresh into AAA just last week for that utility:

Why is the default IIDMStore in AAA the H2Store (using idmlight.db /
idmlight.db.mv.db) ?  How does this, based on h2, even work in a clustered
ODL deployment?

I see there is a CassandraStore also, but why?  Could I get MongoDB & Neo4j
and Redis implementations as well, while we're at it, just because it's
possible? ;-)

Seriously, why isn't the default IIDMStore in ODL OOB just that IDMStore
implementation which seems to be using the ""normal"" ODL DataBroker data
store? Because of ""security"" ? But... everything else in ODL is in there
already anyway, so...

Just wondering and curious. No offense meant to anyone.

I'm glad Michael that you ask these questions, I give +1 to re-enable the
MD-SAL as the backend datastore for AAA. The issue for Bug4702 [0] it is
not there anymore since we moved to  blueprint, moreover using Md-SAL will
keep things in consistent ex: cluster use-case. Also one of the things that
it is really weird on the AAA design, we don't have a mechanism to switch
between the backend data store as we allow multiple datastores. Simply
after installing aaa-shiro feature if someone install aaa-mdsal or
aaa-casendra features this will screw the AAA service.

I give +1  for relying on shiro to  manage the authorization. For the
current role base authorization I believe it is enough and if we want to go
more and apply fine grant permission mechanisms for MD-SAL, we still can
leverage shiro for that.

Finally I believe, we should start deprecate the unused bundles in AAA. As
these bundles no body really contribute to it and they are not been used,
if we keep them, they will open a security threats for ODL.

somewhat secure as well.  In short, we would have to restrict RESTCONF
access to those models on the northbound to the admin role, since only an
admin ought to have CRUD capability there (easy through shiro.ini).  That
still fails to address the fact that the models are still available via
MD-SAL java API(s), which would require some added critical thinking on how
to approach this.  A rogue application could somewhat easily grab the
DataBroker and extract a lot of ""secure"" information.  Maintaining an
encrypted shard may alleviate some of these concerns, but its not how
things are currently handled by that backend.

The fact is, this was added as a cool backend, but I don't think all of the
details were ever fully addressed due to several historical reasons.

Additionally, I'd be careful claiming that ""blueprint fixes the loading
problem automatically""... I do believe there is a bit of extra work
required here in terms of expressing a RESTCONF dependency on AAA
IIDMService.  That said, I haven't ever really looked into solving this as
Brocade has taken the stance that ODL is not an Identity Provider, and that
existing well thought out software should be used.  If your view differs,
that is perfectly fine;  there is room for everyone's strategy :).

Again, I am not against it.  The issue that the MD-SAL based store is not
configurable actually has to deal with the translation from CSS to
blueprint;  in the past the backend was configurable through one of the
08-aaa-*.xml config files.  After that was removed, it is no longer able to
be configured.  I disliked this approach anyway, as Shiro provides the
Realm concept which is a more natural fit for what we are trying to do
anyway, and is injected at start time (highly configurable).

Hope this helps explain some of the history behind this.  I would agree
that using MD-SAL could be a better approach, but it isn't a trivial
problem due to the secure nature of AAA data.

No, the python script is pushed into etc on feature install... this is a hack because I didn't feel like figure out and dealing with the integration distribution.  The main line distribution is here [0];  it is feature based right now... i.e., you add in your features repo and appropriate features to the index.  I have to imagine there is a clever way to add this jar so it is shipped in system/ at least.  That said, I skipped figuring this out because the one-liner I described above was cheap and sufficient for my use case.  Yours obviously needs to happen prior to feature installation (and creation of the idmlight.db.mv.db file).

This requirement has originally been raised by Tim Rozet, who needs this in the context of the ODL installer work he's doing e.g. for OPNFV, see also https://github.com/dfarrell07/puppet-opendaylight/issues/89. Basically, in that context, you want an ""idempotent"" way to create users and set passwords, scripted from an installer (with tools such as Puppet).
Coincidentally, I think the work I'm doing here will also ""solve"" https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=668 ... ""solve"" in quotes because, unless we do more work, there will still be a default uid/pwd created on first start by ODL - unless the IDM h2 DB already exists, created by this new CLI tool - without default uid/pwd (as outlined below; and OK'd by Ryan).

HTH.

Those are the default ones that were decided far before I got involved with the project.  At Brocade, we did not add any other custom roles and relied on the default 2.

couple of use cases that need the ODLPrincipal to be available for me are

1. Audit log of RPCs
2. granular authorization at application level for granularity not
supported by AAA (only certain users are allowed to delete some stuff etc).

Lighting up this discussion again, I'm working on cleaning up AAA, removing
and deprecating unused code. I believe we should take decision on which
datastore we need to proceed with. There are two options:

1- Bring back MDSAL as the default datastore for AAA. Ryan was having
concern about that, I have initially try it and it looks fine but still
need to go through all test cases.
2- Provide a mechanism to switch between data stores. This will require a
massive changes to AAA bundles, services and features but it is not hard to
go there.

The question is: Do we really need to switch between data stores and
provide this option (ex: cluster ODL use mdsal and single ODL use H2) ? Or
we can just processed to bring MD-SAL again and stay with it ?

Thanks

Is there any way to provide resource specific access to different users?

In my use case, user A and B are using RESTCONF over NBI to access list
elements maintained in md-sal operational data store. This is the example
yang schema specific to my case.




*container X {  list L {    key ""user""    leaf user {*


*      ...    }    leaf data {*



*      ...    }  }}*

Use case I am interested in is that, user A should be authorized to access
value (using RESTCONF) in ""data"" field only if list L's element is having
""user"" field set with value 'A' (i.e. username of user A) and similarly
user B should be authorized to access value in ""data"" field only if list
L's element is having ""user"" field set with value 'B'.

Are there any ways to achieve such kind of controlled access, specifically
in pre-karaf helium release?

Thanks.

Thanks for your reply.

As you said, it is not possible with the current implementation and seems
not possible in Helium as well, I am wondering that how such use case
scenarios are being served with ODL. Scenario I have mentioned is a very
practical one where my application (maintaining multiple users) wants to
provide access only to that part of operational data which belongs to a
user or you can say which should be accessible by user restricting access
to other user's data.

To All, please suggest if anyone has achieved any kind of solution to such
problem.

Thanks.

Tips are appreciated !

Can anyone point me to a resource to configure ODL after doing a git pull
and build to install features properly without failing.

If I choose the binary installation everthing works perfectly but when I
pull the source down for a local dev instance compile successfully using
stable or latest code no features install properly. The error generated is
the following:

*opendaylight-user at root>feature:install odl-core*
*Error executing command: Can't install feature odl-core/0.0.0: *
*null*
*opendaylight-user at root>feature:install odl-core*
*Error executing command: Can't install feature odl-core/0.0.0: *
*null*

The beryllium build was successful and I am running ODL form the only karaf
that works in the git which is the following:

controller//karaf/opendaylight-karaf-empty/target/assembly/bin/karaf

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Re: [Aaa-dev] Integration of Keystone with AAA

I have seen mentioned that prior to Boron release there was a preliminary version of integrating Keystone as a backend for AAA.

The past efforts were limited purely to a top level feature definition.  The code had no implementation aside from a no-op Activator, so it was very much green-field.  Thus it was removed.

Do you know if there is currently any interest in reviving that development and completing the integration with Keystone?

AAA was designed as a very modular system because each deployment scenario is going to demand different security constraints.  Integration with Keystone is not on the horizon for any active contributors to my knowledge, but it is something we are open to.  That said, one thing I would like to mention-- we had some guys from OPNFV upstream an OPNFV Moon authentication realm which integrates well with OpenStack from what I am told.  I have cc'd them if you have further questions.

Hope this helps!

In short, no this is not possible.  Internally, ODL stores password hashes,
not plaintext passwords, so the server side is locked down.  From the
client perspective, even if using basic authentication with Base64
username/password, the password is never stored (just read) for security
purposes.

Hope this helps.

I think it would initially be an AuthenticatingRealm, i.e. doing authentication only, and authorization could be added in a later contribution. There would be options to authenticate based on login from AAA to Keystone with a user/password received in RESTCONF, and another option for verifying in Keystone a received token from RESTCONF.

Hi John,

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the AAA project.

I think it would initially be an AuthenticatingRealm, i.e. doing authentication only, and authorization could be added in a later contribution.

That is what I would recommend.  The advantage to using this approach includes the fact that AuthorizingRealm extends AuthenticatingRealm, so if/when you decide to add in the authorization piece, it is fairly easy to refactor.

Overall, the *Realm approach is the preferred method for adding new authentication mechanisms going forward, since they are easy to configure through shiro.ini for all sorts of different deployments.

How do you think we could approach this work?

Seems like you folks are already on the correct path.  Extending AuthenticatingRealm is fairly straightforward-- the interface is very well thought out and easy to use, thanks to the Apache Shiro folks upstream.

In Ericsson we are active in other ODL projects, such as SFC and Genius, but I don?t think we have contributed anything to AAA so far.

No worries-- we are open to contributions from anyone.  Feel free to reach out to the team via email/IRC and our weekly meeting.  One of the aims of AAA is to be adaptive to all different deployment cases, since people are using the controller in many different & interesting ways.  Thanks for your interest in contributing this new authentication mechanism.

Best Regards,

Ryan Goulding

I have seen mentioned that prior to Boron release there was a preliminary version of integrating Keystone as a backend for AAA.

The past efforts were limited purely to a top level feature definition.  The code had no implementation aside from a no-op Activator, so it was very much green-field.  Thus it was removed.

Do you know if there is currently any interest in reviving that development and completing the integration with Keystone?

AAA was designed as a very modular system because each deployment scenario is going to demand different security constraints.  Integration with Keystone is not on the horizon for any active contributors to my knowledge, but it is something we are open to.  That said, one thing I would like to mention-- we had some guys from OPNFV upstream an OPNFV Moon authentication realm which integrates well with OpenStack from what I am told.  I have cc'd them if you have further questions.

Hope this helps!

I am not much of an expert on authorization, but the way I see it is that the actual authorization mechanism / definition is something outside Keystone, so it can be implemented in different ways as long as it coherently processes the role vs. project information retrieved from Keystone. OpenStack services use policy.json files to define and verify authorization , but a service outside OpenStack, such as ODL AAA, could implement it differently.

Subject: RE: [Aaa-dev] Integration of Keystone with AAA

Hi John and Ryan,
It?s an interesting discussion about authorization. We are also working on the authorization with Keystone.
The issue is that Keystone needs a policy.json file to specify authorization policy for each service like Nova, swift, etc.
For ODL, how do you create this file?

Hi John,

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the AAA project.

I think it would initially be an AuthenticatingRealm, i.e. doing authentication only, and authorization could be added in a later contribution.

That is what I would recommend.  The advantage to using this approach includes the fact that AuthorizingRealm extends AuthenticatingRealm, so if/when you decide to add in the authorization piece, it is fairly easy to refactor.

Overall, the *Realm approach is the preferred method for adding new authentication mechanisms going forward, since they are easy to configure through shiro.ini for all sorts of different deployments.

How do you think we could approach this work?

Seems like you folks are already on the correct path.  Extending AuthenticatingRealm is fairly straightforward-- the interface is very well thought out and easy to use, thanks to the Apache Shiro folks upstream.

In Ericsson we are active in other ODL projects, such as SFC and Genius, but I don?t think we have contributed anything to AAA so far.

No worries-- we are open to contributions from anyone.  Feel free to reach out to the team via email/IRC and our weekly meeting.  One of the aims of AAA is to be adaptive to all different deployment cases, since people are using the controller in many different & interesting ways.  Thanks for your interest in contributing this new authentication mechanism.

Best Regards,

Ryan Goulding

Hi Ryan,

I have looked into this further and discussed it with my colleagues in Ericsson and we are interested in contributing to AAA a new backend to Keystone.

I think it would initially be an AuthenticatingRealm, i.e. doing authentication only, and authorization could be added in a later contribution. There would be options to authenticate based on login from AAA to Keystone with a user/password received in RESTCONF, and another option for verifying in Keystone a received token from RESTCONF. Probably we would deliver verification based on user / password first.

No, this is legal.  It is not a problem or a bug.

Sure.

That is not a valid assumption.
Ok. Then, if I login as  ?admin? to delete the same user but have no other users created to access APIs, what will happen to the system? What is the recovery process if this is the case?

Hope this helps.

I have seen mentioned that prior to Boron release there was a preliminary version of integrating Keystone as a backend for AAA. Do you know if there is currently any interest in reviving that development and completing the integration with Keystone?

Thanks,
John

Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

M4 is API freeze.  With something like this, you are really adding an
optional Realm implementation.  True, that impl may have some added API(s),
but we can seek a waiver on those if needed.  Because there are no
downstream dependencies, I don't see the harm in adding them past M4, but
we will need to seek agreement.

 the M5 is coming (03/02 - if I read correctly).


That is correct.

Are we on time to include it on Carbon?


RC0 for offset 0 is 4/13/2017... so we have a bit of runway between M4
(yesterday) and RC0 (when we can only merge blocking bugs).  I don't know
where your team stands on the implementation of this, but it would seem
there is still some time before we absolutely can't get the functionality
into the release.  If this is the case, we have two options:
1) Declare the bug blocking, and seek agreement to allow it into the
release from the release team.  This could be justified as a security
measure, since it improves the compatibility of ODL with outside systems.
2) Seek to add it in an SR, with the justification that it enhances ODL
security.

There are options going forward.  We will need to evaluate which one is
best as the implementation becomes solidified.

Hope this helps.

   I am checking documentation from aaa-cert since I would like to use certificate management service for adding TLS and securing ODL's northbound restconf interface (with jetty). By reading the documentation it seems that the Certificate Mgmt service can be used for two functions:  1. storing ODL certificate and 2. trust store to keep all switches (ext nodes) certificates. However, Can this also be used to secure RESTCONF so that jetty can take certificates from Certificate Manager and/or MDSAL directly?

I see that there are RPCs for:

-          Set/getNodeCertificate. I understand this is used for adding switches (ext nodes) certificates to the truststore.

-          Set/getODLCertificate: I guess this would be the place to store the certificate for securing jetty.

Can this also be used to secure RESTCONF so that jetty can take
certificates from Certificate Manager and/or MDSAL directly?

Yes, you can use certificate manager service to manage RestConf certificate
based auth. There are two mode of operations for the Certificate Manager
service:
1) Single ODL instance case, In this case Certificate manager service use
keystore files .jks that created under configuration/ssl/ directory  to
create self sign certificate and store the trusted certificate. So
basically you can use the configuration exist under [1] and point to the
same keystore.

2) Multi node Cluster ODL case, In this case Certificate manager service
store the keystores in MD-SAL. So you will need programmatically use the
ICertificateManager service and  create the SSLEngine object as the wiki
explained at [2]. I just did a quick search [3] I think it is possible but
it may need some work. OR we may find a way to export the keystores from
MDSAL to configuration/ssl/ directory then jetty can use it as the first
case.

Set/getNodeCertificate. I understand this is used for adding switches (ext
nodes) certificates to the truststore.
yes, you can use this also to store the certificates for securing jetty

Set/getODLCertificate: I guess this would be the place to store the
certificate for securing jetty.
Keep this only for ODL certificate and private key.

do you know how jetty could take certificates from aaa-cert RPCs directly?
I don't think this is possible. Jetty understand only keystore not
certificate string. You need to consume ICertificateManage service to get
the keystore.

Hope this could help, if you have anymore questions let me know.

Please let me ask you just a couple more questions, regarding ODL certificate and private key (the one you configure with set/getODLCertificate) what it is used for? I mean in which uses cases is this certificate being used?

And regarding jetty, my impression is that it cannot get updates on the keystore without being restarted, and this means that after aaa-cert has created/updated the keystore, the only way for jetty to load the certificate is to shutdown and restart karaf, is this correct?

Thank a lot for your support,

I see that there are RPCs for:

  ODL certificate and private key (the one you configure with
set/getODLCertificate) what it is used for?
The certificate manager service by default generate selfsign certificate.
In the case the ODL need to sign its certificate request by CA, It should
first generate a certificate-Req then you can set the ODL certificate.
check the yang model at [1]. To be honest, I didn't see this in production
env till now. Usually in case of root CA signing, we setup the keystore
before packaging ODL and just include it. But the option is there for
future automated deployment.

Regards restart Jetty after updating the keystore
You can try Ryan advice, it will work. The main benefits you get from the
Certificate management service, is managing the keystore certificates
across all the TLS communication that ODL will establish. So you can use
the same Keystore with restconf Jetty connection instead of having multiple
keystore files in ODL.

We should find a way to point etc/jetty.xml SSL configuration to
odl-aaa-cert.xml configuration instead of modifying many config files.

While poking around AAA today (related to Karaf 4 upgrade), I've noticed
that you use felix.dependencymanager in some places.

However, as far as I've seen, AAA does not actually really use
felix.dependencymanager (or not anymore, or never really did; doesn't
matter) ... it's all just a bit of.. confusion, which is confusing.

So I've taken a stab at making a start with completely removing
felix.dependencymanager in AAA for you; done 2 so far, see
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/51576/ and
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/51576/ ...

... there is a bit more to do, similarly to the done aaa-h2-store,
aaa-shiro & aaa-shiro-act are also affected by related confusionism:
aaa-authn-basic, aaa-authn-sssd, aaa-authn-store, aaa-idmlight,
aaa-encrypt-service, aaa-authn-sts, aaa-authn-federation, aaa-authn,
aaa-filterchain, aaa-idp-mapping; plus related features/*.

I was hoping that perhaps some of you active maintainers of AAA would be
willing to jump on finishing this up? I'll even do 1 more, if others jump
on and do the rest... ;-)

I am trying to set my own signed certificate (with a CA) based on a csr given by rpc aaa-cert-rpc:getODLCertificateReq.

After starting karaf first time, the loaded certificate is the one related to alias=""controller"" as stated in xml aaa-cert file (self-signed certificate by default). Then, I set my own signed certificate based on a csr given by rpc aaa-cert-rpc:getODLCertificateReq with rpc setODLCertifcate. It apparently works correctly. I can even put odl-keystore (by means of aaa-cert-mdals restconf) updating alias so that the related to my certificate is set (let's say ""odl1""). Even if I invoke getODLCertificate rpc it returns my certificate (the one related to ""odl1"").
But, when I restart karaf (with or without clean option and debugging with -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake), the ""found key for : controller"" log message shows the former alias ""controller"", karaf keeps loading the initial ODL self-signed certificate. Nevertheless, checking mdsal config for aaa-cert, I can see that everything stays as described above, this is, odl-kestore with both certificates and alias set to ""odl1"".
I performed several tests and I think that, no matter what alias field contains in odl-keystore, the first certificate in the encrypted keyfile is always the one loaded on ssl initialization. And that certificate can't be overwritten either deleted.
Testing without mdsal, provisioning keystore.jks file with keytool, I have no problem when removing the default odl self-signed certificate and adding my own one. I can even provisioning several certificates and they are all loaded when starting karaf:

found key for : odlserver
chain [0] = [

Just to clarify things, As I understand everything is working fine till you
restart ODL, then there are 2 scenarios:

1- if you are using (first option) keystore files that exist under
configuration/ssl/ to store the certificates then you need to update the
<alias> at aaa-cert-config.xml if you change it at runtime. ODL not update
the initial config xml files if you change the initial values at runtime.

2- if you are using (second option) MD-SAL to store the certificate. So
keep in mind that the initial config that exist at aaa-cert-config.xml will
be used only for the first time ODL start to create the keystores then all
the config will be stored at MD-SAL. Next time ODL start will read the
config that exist in MD-SAL not at aaa-cert-confg.xml. If that the case,
maybe the Certificate Manager service not updating the MD-SAL initial

Would you confirm which scenario you have ? If I miss understand just give

First of all, thanks for your answers.

Regarding Ryan?s question, I am using OVSDB project with the patch described in https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OVSDB_Integration:TLS_Communication.
I am using the same patch when using ?jks? files and mdsal, it basically instantiates a Certificate Management Service .
When I add several certificates in keystore.jks they are all loaded on ssl initialization but, when I use mdsal and aaa-cert-rpcs to add several certificates, even when all certificates are correctly added to odl-keystore, only the one created by default by ODL (the first one) is loaded when restarting karaf (ssl initialization). But the mdsal still contains the other certificates.

Regarding Mohamed question, I tested both scenarios:


1.      With ?jks? files, no matter what alias is set, all certificates stored in keystore file are loaded on ssl initialization, bellow you can see java debug traces (2 keys stored: odlserver and odl2)
found key for : odlserver
chain [0] = [
[
?
]
***
***
found key for : odl2
chain [0] = [
[


2.      With mdsal, no matter what alias is set either, only the first certificate will be loaded:
found key for : odlserver
?

We are trying to figure out why the other certificates are not loaded when working with mdsal. It looks like only the first certificate in keyfile field is found.

Based on your finding there are two possibilities; 1- when you add signed
ODL certificate, you should add the CA certificate in both Trust and ODL
keystores, did you tried that? 2- You may try to have the signed
certificates and CA certificate only in the ODL-Keystore. there are
importSslDataKeystores and exportSslDataKeystores methods can help do this
if you are able to change the source code.  just try the first option.

we miss some rpc method to remove possible revoked certificates from both
odl-keystore and most importantly truststore keyfiles

In fact, There are some functions I'm planning to add them but just matter
of time. you can use aaa-cli command [1] there are commands can help.

Also feel free if you find a fix for that issue to push patch, we will
review and merge it.

Thanks for your answer.

We already tested the first option but it still isn?t working. We are working on some fix to be able to provide our own signed certificate based on ODL request. We?ll keep you informed.

On the other hand, we observed that aaa-cert refactoring was backported to stable/boron branch.

Subject: Re: [Aaa-dev] Adding signed certificate by CA to odl-keystore with aaa-cert-rpc:setODLCertifcate

Hi Ricardo,

Based on your finding there are two possibilities; 1- when you add signed ODL certificate, you should add the CA certificate in both Trust and ODL keystores, did you tried that? 2- You may try to have the signed certificates and CA certificate only in the ODL-Keystore. there are importSslDataKeystores and exportSslDataKeystores methods can help do this if you are able to change the source code.  just try the first option.

we miss some rpc method to remove possible revoked certificates from both odl-keystore and most importantly truststore keyfiles

In fact, There are some functions I'm planning to add them but just matter of time. you can use aaa-cli command [1] there are commands can help.

Also feel free if you find a fix for that issue to push patch, we will review and merge it.

Thanks

Hi Mohamed and Ryan,

We debugged aaa-cert in order to find out why only the first ODL certificate is loaded on ssl initialization. Order has nothing to do. Following we try to describe our findings:

First of all, our signed certificates (based on ODL certificate requests and not self-signed) are not loaded by java class SunX509KeyManagerImpl because they are not a ?KeyEntry?.

On the other hand, ODL self-signed certificate generated by default is created and added to odl-keystore with PrivateKey:

-          Jetty only needs a file: keystore, to be able to handle its own certificate and trusted certificates from clients.

?  org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password=password

?  org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=password

-          Trusted certs can be added to keystore (no need to create a separated truststore file).

o   Note there are three types in a keystore are: PrivateKey, Trusted and Secret.



-          During ODL execution it is possible to update the keystore. I found a mechanism to restart Jetty without restarting ODL. Just restart Jetty bundle:

o   bundle:restart -f $(bundle:id ""OPS4J Pax Web - Jetty"")



-          Using client certificates works perfectly well for RestConf. I added the client's self-signed certificate to the keystore (as trusted entry) and worked fine. As an interesting fact, if I add the same certificate as PrivateKey entry, it works as well.

I am planning on adding a number of test cases to csit covering this behaviour. I will send a separate mail to start a discussion.
Any thoughts?

My idea is to launch aaa test when committing aaa code patches and having following keywords in the comment section:

?        ""test-aaa-keystone"" will launch aaa-csit-1node-keystone-all-{stream} job

Nowadays aaa-csit-1node-keystone-all-{stream} does not exist yet; but I'm testing it in Sandbox and I will upload it when ready in the coming days.

 As mentioned in the previous mail I would like to add some tests to aaa project to show some basic HTTPS/TLS communication in RESTCONF, using also client certificates. The purpose is also to write down the steps needed to configure ODL as secure server (documented as a set of working test cases).

The tests would be something like:

Test secure RESTCONF request, using server's certificate
Test secure RESTCONF request, using server's certificate and client certificate
Repeat above items with a request for Jolokia data (e.g. cluster mbeans)
If previous items were done with self-signed certificates, then repeat with CA signed certificates
Additionally I could include some tests with revocation lists.

They would be intended for clustered environment, thus I would need to handle the keystore directly with keytool across every node in the cluster.
Would you consider it as a proper contribution?

Miguel ?ngel Mu?oz.

I am working on some changes in the ODL AAA module to permit authentication using OpenStack Keystone as an external identity provider backend.

My idea is that networking-odl driver could receive and forward in the RESTCONF, user credentials or token that came in the triggering petition to Neutron, or maybe the credentials or token related to the Neutron service user itself.  Do you think this is feasible to do in networking-odl driver? Is it somehow possible already or would it be a lot of work? Would it require any changes in Neutron itself, or just in the ODL driver?

Are you talking about federating using OpenStack as an Identity Provider?  If so, some folks on Ericsson's side are already working on this...

They are creating an optional AuthorizingRealm (really Authenticating at the moment) that forwards access request challenges on to OpenStack.

Hope this helps...

Yes, I commented out the part related to controllerKeyStore/controllerTrustStore and secureChannelEnable properties and I still have jetty running with its own certificate and using client certificates. This is the custom.properties I have:

[?]
#secureChannelEnabled=true
#controllerKeyStore=configuration/ssl/.keystore

#controllerTrustStorePassword=123456

org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=123456
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.clientauthneeded=true

Regarding [key|trusted]store, I agree it would be nicer to have them both separated in two different files/places. I think Jetty is capable of doing that. However I am not fully sure about PaxWeb. I think it is still possible but need to investigate it further.  Having a look to [1] does not seem straightforward but maybe using jetty.xml directly it is possible.

Thank you,

?  org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password=password

?  org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=password

?  org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.clientauthneeded=true



-          Trusted certs can be added to keystore (no need to create a separated truststore file).

o   The only thing to be aware of is that the entry type in the keystore for these trusted certs has to be different: Instead of PrivateKeyEntry they have to be Trusted entry)

o   Note there are three types in a keystore are: PrivateKey, Trusted and Secret.



-          During ODL execution it is possible to update the keystore. I found a mechanism to restart Jetty without restarting ODL. Just restart Jetty bundle:

o   bundle:restart -f $(bundle:id ""OPS4J Pax Web - Jetty"")



-          Using client certificates works perfectly well for RestConf. I added the client?s self-signed certificate to the keystore (as trusted entry) and worked fine. As an interesting fact, if I add the same certificate as PrivateKey entry, it works as well.

I am planning on adding a number of test cases to csit covering this behaviour. I will send a separate mail to start a discussion.
Any thoughts?

Thanks everyone for your help on this matter,
Best Regards,
Miguel ?ngel Mu?oz.

Then, if they are specific, I think we'll need a separate section for the configuration of the new Keystone Auth, I'll update the patch accordingly.

Once the User Guide introduces the concept of realms (AAA Realms) we have the TokenAuthRealm Configuration and its two ways of configuring it: the idmtool and the REST API.

Following this thread, I have another question. In AAA's User Guide I can read the following paragraph:

idmtool Configuration<file:///home/edavsua/git-repositories/docs/docs/_build/html/user-guide/authentication-and-authorization-services.html?highlight=aaa#idmtool-configuration>

A utility script located at ?etc/idmtool? is used to manipulate the TokenAuthRealm IdM policy. idmtool assumes a single domain (sdn), since multiple domains are not leveraged in the Boron release


Is the limitation of single domain (sdn) for idmtool only or for the RESTful Web Service API as well?


Best regards,

David Su?rez.

Ok. Then I am going to change the User Guide a little to not state ""sdn"" as the default domain for AAA, but only the TokenAuthRealm. The new Keystone Realm will use ""default"" as default domain to correspond with the Openstack's default domain.

user perspective since it will have the automatic restconf/netconf
bindings.  You can use it today in Carbon (working on a back port to
Boron), and the only difference between it and shiro.ini impl is that the
url pattern is relative to ""/"" instead of the individual servlet context.
For example, while using shiro.ini and locking down streams, you would use
url pattern ""/streams/**"".  With the new approach, you use the url pattern
""/restconf/streams/**"".  shiro chooses to do things relative to the servlet
context as it greatly simplifies some of the authorization logic on their
side (especially when using annotation based authz).   If you want a demo
of how this works, I am more than happy to jump on a webex with you folks

api doc explorer is actually part of the netconf project, so +netconf-dev.

The api doc explorer will still enumerate every single API assuming correct
credentials are provided.  That is the way it was written, and it was not
my choice.  However, you can restrict which roles can actually execute
those API commands (they will still appear in the web page though!).  As of
Carbon release, you can achieve this sort of Authorization through using
the ""aaa"" model and accompanying MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter (enabled
on RESTCONF by default).  Information on the aaa model can be found in the
README [0] under MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter and will also be added to
our proper documentation prior to the Carbon release.

Notes on LDAP integration are already included here [1] under
ODLJndiLdapRealm.

Hope this helps!

Asunto: Re: [Aaa-dev] Requirement for role based md-sal api and netconf mounted api

Hi Om,

api doc explorer is actually part of the netconf project, so +netconf-dev.

The api doc explorer will still enumerate every single API assuming correct credentials are provided.  That is the way it was written, and it was not my choice.  However, you can restrict which roles can actually execute those API commands (they will still appear in the web page though!).  As of Carbon release, you can achieve this sort of Authorization through using the ""aaa"" model and accompanying MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter (enabled on RESTCONF by default).  Information on the aaa model can be found in the README [0] under MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter and will also be added to our proper documentation prior to the Carbon release.

Notes on LDAP integration are already included here [1] under ODLJndiLdapRealm.

Hope this helps!

Regards,

Ryan Goulding

Hi,

We  are doing some research  in ODL AAA plugin and trying to see if we can have role bases access to md-sal api from API Doc explorer .  for Example , ppl with certain role can access view and access only certain api in the API DOC.

We are trying to use LDAP for authentication  and role.  Can you please help us or guide is from where we can start looking in to this or give us some design to work in this.

Thanks
Om Prakash

I am still trying to push a new version of this patch. Everything

We would like to test our contribution in master branch before implementing
the authorization module, but the moon driver doesn't work.

I think it's due to the fact the code has been mooved from aaa-shiro/src to
aaa-shiro/impl/src .

Do you have a suggestion to test our code without reorganizing the code
base.

Subject: Re: [Aaa-dev] proposal for AAA Authorization with Keystone

The new model based approach should be a lot easier to maintain from an end user perspective since it will have the automatic restconf/netconf bindings.  You can use it today in Carbon (working on a back port to Boron), and the only difference between it and shiro.ini impl is that the url pattern is relative to ""/"" instead of the individual servlet context.  For example, while using shiro.ini and locking down streams, you would use url pattern ""/streams/**"".  With the new approach, you use the url pattern ""/restconf/streams/**"".  shiro chooses to do things relative to the servlet context as it greatly simplifies some of the authorization logic on their side (especially when using annotation based authz).   If you want a demo of how this works, I am more than happy to jump on a webex with you folks at some point.

Subject: Re: [Aaa-dev] proposal for AAA Authorization with Keystone

Just FYI, we are starting to dissuade the use of shiro.ini to write authorization rules.  In general, shiro.ini will eventually die, but it will take a few release cycles.  This was discussed with Mike V. and others on the last Kernel Projects call-- shiro.ini was useful to get Shiro based concepts in for JSF, but it is not a good long term solution as it is not cluster aware and not really SOA.  If you extract the correct roles in doGetAuthorizationInfo for your AuthorizingRealm, you can use an even more modern approach I introduced here:

https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/50694/

This allows you to define RBAC rules for HTTP in the more traditional model based approached, and is more future proof.  My apologies for missing the meeting, if you have questions, feel free to reach out to me on IRC or email.

It's not recommended to use MD-SAL, In fact it is not possible for the
current AAA data store implementation. However, you can still retrieve the
user identity info from H2 database (default datastore for AAA). check the
IIDMStore class at aaa-authn-api bundle [0] and aaa-h2-store bundle [1].

Which ODL release you use ? anyway uninstall ODL features is not supported
and it cause issues. In karaf4 upgrade there are enhancement at ODL for
this issue but I believe it is still work in progress. Check the discussion
at [0].
If you are using master, the aaa-mdsal bundle is working fine but the issue
is you will need to replace the odl-aaa-authn feature encapsulated under
 odl-aaa-shiro feature with odl-aaa-mdsal-cluster feature. Then build
everything it will work.

whether this also happens in single node scenario as well.  It would appear
that when BP is instantiating the CertificateManagerService that a call
which decrypts the keystore file location [1] is failing due to a
PaddingException. If I had to guess, I would say that the leaf is probably
an empty string... probably a race between the value being written
initially (somewhere in the AAAEncryptionService instantation) and then
read in the CertificateManagerService instantiation.

at this point, I don't know if I'm hitting a bug or not. The suite creates
a domain (that works) then tries to create a user. Before 55029, there was
no domain in the user create. But, now with the domainid there, I get a
500 error back (NPE). I tried with both the ""name"" of the domain (which is
how I saw it in a user guide) as well as the ""id"". both seem to give the
same error:

do we need a bug, or do we need to do something different in the test.

I would like to improve the Moon driver realm but the code in
 aaa-shiro/impl/ is no longer appearing in eclipse (project explorer) with
the new hierarchy of AAA and that makes difficult to add  new code



I also observe that karaf debugging mode fails to a few seconds after
?./bin/karaf debug?.



Any suggestion to solve these issues ?

There is no log because that process running on 5005 stops a few seccond

I use intellij.  You may have to mess with the settings to get it ot import

look in Nitrogen.

there is no karaf.log or karaf.out?

I use intellij.  You may have to mess with the settings to get it ot import correctly.  Someone was working on a fix in Carbon but it slipped; we will look in Nitrogen.

Hi Ryan,
There is no log because that process running on 5005 stops a few seccond after ""/bin/karaf debug"". I wonder it's due to a misconfigution in AAA project ?

Which IDE do you use to import the project ?

I am not familiar with eclipse import procedures.  The issue is likely that the package naming doesn't contain impl.  This was done on purpose, as when we moved to archetype setup we didn't update the packages.  That is because for some long historical reasons, downstream dependencies would need to be updated too.  That is a lot of work and not suited for pre release activity.

I also observe that karaf debugging mode fails to a few seconds after ?./bin/karaf debug?.

Is there an error message?  Not really giving us much to go on here...

Anyone have any ideas?  This comes from this patch [0]'s verify job,

not even sure why this test started randomly failing.  Any help is
appreciated.

 Restarting the BP container is OK.  Ideally <clustered-app-config> could
be embedded in a bean and invoke an update method when it changes (similar
to <cm:managed-properties>). That's on my TODO list....

commands were changed somewhat drastically between Boron-SR2 and Boron-SR3,
which is probably not in the spirit of SRs. While we're somewhat less
strict about adding features in SRs. Taking them out without a lot of
warning and notice is pretty much the definition of what we try to never do
in SRs.

That being said, we're trying to make the best of it and looking for help
in understanding how to get the functionality we rely on from AAA back in
Boron-SR3.

This patch seems to be the issue:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/51649/

Is there somebody that can comment on how we might recover the
functionality that used to be provided by the gen-odl-ks and gen-trust-ks
CLI commands? Would simply reverting that patch work or would it break
other things as well?

Thanks,

You are not suppose to use them after the changes that we made in the
patch. Basically these functionalities were there because of the keystores
need to be generated after starting ODL. But now, the keystore will be
created once you install the aaa-cert feature. keeping this functionalities
could make a serious security thread.

Unfortunately, this is going to be the easiest path forward for the initial
Carbon release.  There will be work in Nitrogen to remedy this, and I have
already opened an enhancement bug (8315) to track its progress.  This is a
very strange scenario, and will require more thinking to tackle properly.

For Carbon, The keystores stored at MD-SAL not as files OR if you will
change the config to store the keystores as files, it will be under
configuration/ssl/ . I guess Those files are created by the unit Test

functionality is broken in Boron-SR3? If so, we need to figure out if
there's a work-around and if so, document it in the Boron-SR3 release notes.

Can we get documentation for how somebody is supposed to:
1.) create the ODK keystore and trust keystore (replacing gen-odl-ks and
gen-trust-ks)
2.) add a certificate to the ODL and turst keystores (replacing
add-odl-cert and add-trust-cert)

I _think_ those are the only CLI commands we removed. It appears as though
the replacement for 1.) is just feature:install odl-aaa-cert which will
create the keystores automatically now.

It's less clear what the replacement to 2.) is. It appears as though the
RPCs which should replace them throw NPEs. Is the workaround until we fix
that (in Boron-SR4?) to use keytool from the Linux CLI?

I test the aa-cert RPCs with Boron and it works fine, did u change the
aaa-cert-config.xml file ? I guess you may missed that. basically you need
to change the <use-config> to true if you want to use keystore files and
change <use-mdsal> true if you want to store  the keystores in mdsal. Then
don't forget to restart karaf. check the wiki for more info

Hi Colin,

Can we get documentation for how somebody is supposed to:
1.) create the ODK keystore and trust keystore (replacing gen-odl-ks and
gen-trust-ks)
yes, just after installing the aaa-cert feature and changing the
aaa-cert-config the keystore will be created. You can also use the java
keytool commands to create the keystore instead. Moreover, If you wish to
use a pre-created keystores signed by CA just copy those files to
 directory configuration/ssl/ and change the aaa-cert-config.xml
<use-config> to true  odl will use those files

2.) add a certificate to the ODL and turst keystores (replacing
add-odl-cert and add-trust-cert)
use the RPCs to do this.

So what happens is that in Boron both <use-config> and <use-mdsal> are set to false by default and as a minimum you need to set the first to true for the feature to work. In Carbon both are set to true by default so the feature works out-of-the-box.

I have a question, originally mentioned as a comment
in a Bug ... I am unable to locate right now.

Anyway, it is related to various bugs
such as 7792 [1] and 8209 [2].
As more specific symptoms (8214 [3], 8062 [4])
are fixed now, I begin to suspect the 401 status
is actually expected from an isolated cluster member.

I think AAA is storing some data to mdsal datastore,
which is of course inaccessible on minority partition.

Now, other http status codes (503) might be better,
but 401 is fine as long as it gets documented.

We will update suites to expect the agreed upon response.

Vratko.

it for compatibility purposes, but just recommend using ""sdn"".  I.e.,
network segmentation over RESTCONF is something that you are better off

Just to continue this thread in case anyone is ever looking through
archives, I have proposed a fix here [0].  Since ids should be considered
an internal detail, I repeated the checks for all other aspects of the AAA
data store (grantid, userid, roleid, domainid).  In the case that someone
does specify an id, a 400 HTTP error message is returned to the client,
since the client request is flawed.  Does this seem like a good approach?

For reference, we are hoping to migrate to an OOB MDSAL based store in
Nitrogen.

Would you mind to prioritize this merge once stable/carbon is open again? It is the cherry-pick that we forgot to do and we need it before we downstream carbon.

Still working to get CSIT running. Some of the test cases are passing,
but the update cases are failing, so I filed this bug. There are
manual reproduction steps in the bug. Maybe there is something I'm
not doing right?

The CSIT job, is showing all cases as failed, but that's because the
suite teardown fails and marks everything as failed at that point.
I'll try looking at that next.

I know there has been a little activity this release to add system test

under the impression that those are nearly all vetted, with known, open

Any top-level features not covered by CSIT should fall in to the experimental

I think we can talk about this in the next Weekly meeting, but in the meantime, if you have the time, we can exchange some emails about the topic ;)

Repeat above items with a request for Jolokia data (e.g. cluster mbeans)

Jolokia authentication is handled on its own right now, separate from AAA.  I pushed a patch to Jolokia to allow us to tie into Jolokia's challenge mechanism, but still haven't built an ODL impl yet [0].

Would you consider it as a proper contribution?

Without seeing the actual code, I can't blindly say it will be accepted.  However, your plan seems thorough and well thought out, and additional system tests are always appreciated as they really do help harden the product.

Hi everyone,
 As mentioned in the previous mail I would like to add some tests to aaa project to show some basic HTTPS/TLS communication in RESTCONF, using also client certificates. The purpose is also to write down the steps needed to configure ODL as secure server (documented as a set of working test cases).

The tests would be something like:

Test secure RESTCONF request, using server?s certificate
Test secure RESTCONF request, using server?s certificate and client certificate
Repeat above items with a request for Jolokia data (e.g. cluster mbeans)
If previous items were done with self-signed certificates, then repeat with CA signed certificates
Additionally I could include some tests with revocation lists.

They would be intended for clustered environment, thus I would need to handle the keystore directly with keytool across every node in the cluster.
Would you consider it as a proper contribution?

1. Could we have the problem of the Authenticator class configured not
being found through the class loader that is being used at that point?

2. Wouldnt be another option to repackage the Jolokia WAR as a bundle
with our own web.xml directives to map the servlet to AAA/Shiro filter?

3. There is still the open issue of the circular dependency, right?

BR
Jaime.

As a part of Brocade, we had committed some code for Callhome in netconf project few months back. As a part of the review, some utilities were identified to be a part of AAA service since these could be used generically across projects. Also, now we may need these utilities as a part of different effort in netconf project.

These utilities basically provide conversion of Public and private keys to Strings and from Strings to public/private kay pairs.


In an effort to appropriately place the code and have proper dependencies, i have restructured the code and made it a part of aaa-encryption service.

Test code has also been committed for these.


Patch URL: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/58452/


Please take a look at this patch and let me know if there are any comments.


Thanks

My name is Ryan Goulding, and I am a Project Lead on ODL, an open source SDN platform.  We depend on oltu for oauth2 implementation in our AAA implementation.  However, one of the issues we are currently running into is the controversial nature surrounding the org.json/json license that includes the famous ?do no evil? clause.  It appears that you utilize org.json [0] despite the controversial license.  Is there any plan to move away from org.json in the future, or is this something you plan to stick with for the foreseeable future?  Would be great to hear back from you so we can decide how to proceed, since our aim is to remove org.json/json from ODL in our next release.

Thanks and best regards!

Anyone successfully boot up a Karaf 4.X instance with Shiro 1.4.0?   I am a
developer on the ODL project and trying to make the transition from
shiro-core 1.3.2 -> 1.4.0 and running into a runtime dependency issue that
I can't seem to resolve.  I added all of the new dependencies caused by
modularizing shiro-core into separate artifacts in 1.4.0, but still run
into this:

*opendaylight-user at root>feature:install odl-aaa-shiro*
*Error executing command: Unable to resolve
org.apache.shiro.crypto.cipher/1.4.0: missing requirement
[org.apache.shiro.crypto.cipher/1.4.0] osgi.wiring.package;
filter:=""(&(osgi.wiring.package=org.apache.shiro)(version>=1.4.0)(!(version>=2.0.0)))""*
*opendaylight-user at root>*

I have the crypto packages as dependencies as shown here [0].  Any
suggestions on this is extremely helpful!  Would love to stay current and
on the latest release but this is currently blocking our upgrade.

As it stands, this will block our upgrade of Shiro for now.  Not quite sure
what it will take for us to move on to 1.4.X stream quite yet, spent two
attempts and about 10 hours on something that should've been essentially a
number change... Seems like something is not being exported from the bundle

How do you propose support would be handled?  There are no scheduled or planned releases for ODL Boron ever again, and anything merged to stable/boron will never be realized in an upstream release barring an emergency security release.  For all intents and purposes it is cooked...

How did you try to disable?  There were some known loading issues but 0.4.0.Boron is quite old.  In fact Boron is no longer in support at all.  I'd recommend using Carbon.

Hi all

I have built a project using base architype plus netconf and bgp. The project installs and have no errors, however when trying to access any of the services I get 401 error(printed below this email).

Suspecting that might be Shiro problem, I tried to disable it at etc/shiro.ini however now Im getting 503 errors.

Any helps on this would be appreciated

so yeah - I need to do a major upgrade to get it all Nitrogen-ready.  Might change one or two more literals to environment vars too.

later, but wanted to chime in now to say that the TSC agreed a long time
ago to support bug fixes in service releases for the previous release,
e.g., Carbon while working toward releasing Nitrogen, and then off-cycle
releases for security issues as needed for the privous two releases, e.g.,
Boron and Carbon while working toward releasing Nitrogen.

This isn't a limit saying that we can'd do other things or that we can't
still support them by helping with questions, but it's a statement of the
minimum level of support we agree to provide to our releases. That being
said, we have typically not had the gratuitious resources to provide heavy
support for older releases and typically the community has had waning
interest in fixing issues in releases older that 1-2 back. That being said,
we're maturing as a community and platform, so the massive differences
between releases have been somewhat less pronounced recently. We could
re-evaluate it if need be.

odlparent 2.0.2 has been released. The changes since 2.0.1 are as
follows:
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/59932 ? ensure script permissions
  are correct (https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8798)
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/59939 ? preserve our patches in
  the final Karaf distribution
  (https://bugs.opendaylight.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8799)
* https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/59837 ? disable SFT on feature
  repositories by default

odlparent 2.0.2 is once again capable of producing a working
distribution, unlike 2.0.1 (sorry!). It has passed CSIT on NetVirt, and
a round of local testing.

The only blocking issues fixed in this release affect karaf4-parent, so
the upgrade requirements are minimal:
* integration/distribution needs to upgrade to 2.0.2
* all project modules inheriting from karaf4-parent and currently using
  2.0.1 need to upgrade to 2.0.2

Apart from that, most projects are free to upgrade as they wish; the
exceptions are aaa and netconf which need to upgrade to at least 2.0.1
to ensure the Bouncy Castle dependencies are coherent. But I would
strongly encourage all projects to upgrade to 2.0.2 at their earliest
convenience.

(I have tested various mixed configurations with no issue, including
Robert?s proposed test using restconf with a 2.0.2 dependency and
bgpcep with a 2.0.1 dependency, and simultaneously loading features.)

just stumbled upon https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/59988/ by
coincidence, and was wondering if you guys really meant to copy/paste (not
move) all of the code from aaa-h2-store code into aaa-shiro?

Not sure that's really such a great idea / design... one ALWAYS ends up
ultimately regretting copy/paste'd code, IMHO. Can't you just add a
dependency from aaa-shiro to aaa-h2-store?

In aaa meeting, We agree that we need to move all the AAA data store
bundles ( H2 and MD-SAL) to be under the same bundle with aaa-shiro. There
are many benefits from doing that e.g easy maintain code and bundle
dependencies. same time we doing refactoring on the go to make the source
code in same design style.  You can join us next meeting we will discuss
this in more details.

So to get a valid INSTANCE, it must be created via the aaa-shiro-impl BP
which injects a non-null ShiroConfiguration. So it seems
KarafIniWebEnvironment is racing with the BP container.  This is a bit
fragile - I think getInstance should just return the INSTANCE and not
create it and KarafIniWebEnvironment should busy wait on that (with a
sleep). Also INSTANCE should be volatile.

Jersey 2 so that jersey instantiates these objects through java code and

wiring.  There is a separate stopgap I was investigating through using a
web.xml Listener but it appears that doesn't work.  This at least gets us
over the initial bug, but the long term solution is to use Jersey 2.

Subject: [AAA] Help about Keystone AAA
To: Ryan Goulding <ryandgoulding at gmail.com>


Hi Ryan,



I am trying to do my setup for AAA feature as per attached steps. But I am
unable to use postman to create a user. PFA for the screen shot of the
error that I am seeing.



192.168.56.102 is the Ubuntu VM where my keystone is running and I can see
35357 port in LISTEN state to confirm that keystone is running.



Below 2 are my concern points where I feel something is missing:



1.       keystoneAuthRealm.keystoneServerURL =
https:*//192.168.56.102*:35357 <https://192.168.56.102:35357>

2.       https://192.168.56.102:35357/v3/users is the URL that I am
using. (Not sure though about the basic authentication details
required here)





Can you please help me out here ?



Thanks,

Vamsi

HowTo add the certificate to the keystore
CERT=${CERT_PATH}/${CERT_NAME}.pem
 
# import the certificate
sudo keytool -import -alias keystone_cert -file $CERT -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
 
# delete the certificate from the JVM cacerts
sudo keytool -delete -alias keystone_cert -keystore /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit
HowTo provision the keystore
Postman Collection for CRUD operations in Domain, Project, User and Token:
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/cbd22b040b3da8affa68
nginx config files
HTTP config file
HTTPS server side auth config file
HTTPS mutual auth config file
To reload the nginx config execute the command below - within the container

# reload the nginx config
nginx -s reload

# Run the test case
Dynamic authorization
In order to use the dynamic authorization module, shiro has to be properly configured - which, by default, it already is. Just make sure you have the following lines uncommented:

dynamicAuthorization = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter
# ...
/** = authcBasic, dynamicAuthorization
This activates the dynamic authz filter. By default, if no policies are provisioned, everyone has access to all resources.

To provision an authz policy into ODL, use the following REST end-point

 PUT /config/aaa:http-authorization
 {
   ""aaa:http-authorization"": {
     ""aaa:policies"": {
       ""aaa:policies"": [
         {
           ""aaa:resource"": ""/**"",
           ""aaa:permissions"": [
             {
               ""aaa:role"": ""admin"",
               ""aaa:actions"": [
                 ""get"",
                 ""delete"",
                 ""put"",
                 ""post""
               ]
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
 }
The aforementioned policy will grant access to any resource for users having the admin role, for the POST / PUT / GET / DELETE HTTP methods. The method list is inclusive - meaning that the user will lose access to any method not specified within the method list.

Hello Vamsi

Even though you may have keystone running and listening on that port,
there seems to be a connectivity problem from where you are running
postman to that keystone instance. Maybe you should try first to run
Postman within that VM. Or even telnet there from different places to
check where it is being dropped.

I needed this change in one of the netconf password encryption patches (for carbon and nitrogen) and changed it after discussing on the kernel call. I will take care of not making API changes to stable branches now. As Ryan has already reverted this patch from carbon, I will go ahead with the plan for putting it on Nitrogen and hopefully there will be enough time to resolve downstream dependencies.

morning that have not migrated to odlparent 2.0.4 yet and we have submitted
patches here [0].

Currently autorelease is failing to build due to bier but we are worried
that additional projects also need to bump so have prepared patches for all
the projects we could find.

Can we get these in before the next autorelease nitrogen build?

my name is Lea Gr?ber. I am a researcher in computer science at Saarland University, Germany. My group is currently conducting a user study to investigate the usability of security libraries. 

We figured out that you use odl-aaa-encryption-service as a security library in https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa <https://github.com/opendaylight/aaa>.  
We would be very interested in the reasons why you decided for this specific library and did not choose a different one. 
Therefore, we would like to invite the developers who worked with this lib and were involved in the decision to participate in a brief interview on the phone, on Skype or slack.

In principle I am interested in any security-relevant library you might have worked with. It does not have to be in a special project or programming language.
If you worked with other security libs, those are equally relevant for this study. (In general a security-relevant library is a lib, that solves a security related programming task for you, e.g. authentication, signing or encryption - or just the generation of a secure hash value).

If participating in this line of research sounds interesting to you and you would like to support my current work, please contact me either via email, Skype or Slack:

We need a respin, I think.

If not that, I can file some blocker bug(s) for us to track the problems we see

Do we have a list of all the applicable patches that we need to merge into

We still need team members to review the CSIT failures for the following

Subject: Re: [controller-dev] [OpenDaylight TSC] Nitrogen RC1 Build CSIT Failures

Netvirt has a lot of problems, mostly all due to the same (assuming) clustering issues we saw in carbon. I think those are mostly resolved now with hard work from people like Sam, Robert and Tom. But, I don't think those changes were merged in nitrogen when the autorelease job ran which triggered these tests.

We need a respin, I think.

If not that, I can file some blocker bug(s) for us to track the problems we see in the netvirt CSIT.

Thanks,

This comes as a result of a certain enhancements done during Carbon SR1 for
netconf password encryption. If the password is not encrypted, the code
still tries to decrypt and though it doesnt impact anything and same
password is used, an exception is thrown from AAA module on this. It
couldnt be curtailed during that time because change in AAA was impacting
some downstream projects. It should not the case with releases after Carbon
SR1. If not, please file a bug to show a warning here instead of error.

Thanks

ocpplugin, odlparent, of-config, openflowplugin, opflex, packetcable, snmp,

As communicated earlier, milestone status needs to be submitted as
reStructuredText file (similar to release notes) into the docs project -
see Section 4, item aa in TSC meeting minutes [1].   All submitted and
merged milestone readouts can be viewed here to make them readily
accessible [2] - note that we have converted the M0 emails into rst files
for all the participating projects.

Please make a copy of the m1 status template file [3], update, and submit
your milestone readout into this folder of the docs project:
""docs/release-process/milestone-readouts/m1"".

There is a useful online reStructuredText tool [4] you can use to validate
your rst file contents - copy the rst file contents into the left pane and
you will see the rendered HTML on the right pane.

Note that 20 projects have submitted their m1 status and merged - Thank
you!  Please feel free to use them as references.

We ended the Kernel Projects call early today as there was very low
participation (two attendees).  I am hoping that this is just because
people are busy with other priorities this week :).

I will send out an email next Monday as a reminder that we have an upcoming

We see this error only after karaf4 migration. And it works on some of the setups, but fails in some.
Since the log says ClassNotFoundException, is this some dependency ordering problem?

    We are not doing any new features downstream. We just have synced the master code, and built a distribution.
    The only feature we are trying to install is odl-restconf-all. This works in some of the setups, but not always.

     When it works, I do see that HttpService is being pulled in by :

      opendaylight-user at root>bundle:services | grep -B 9 HttpService
OPS4J Pax Web - Jetty (392) provides:

[org.ops4j.pax.web.service.spi.ServerControllerFactory]

OPS4J Pax Web - Runtime (394) provides:

[org.ops4j.pax.web.service.spi.ServletListener]
[org.osgi.service.cm.ManagedService]
[org.osgi.service.http.HttpService, org.ops4j.pax.web.service.WebContainer]


SelectChannelConnector class is seen only in 8.1 version of jetty, I am not sure whether there is any ordering problem in this case.
I do see two jetty-server related jars even in working as well as non-working setups.

org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all-server/8.1.14.v20131031/
org/eclipse/jetty/jetty-server/9.2.19.v20160908/

Since the log says ClassNotFoundException, is this some dependency ordering problem?

Faseela, where do you see this, migrating what to Karaf 4? Is this a problem seen only in a downstream distribution we cannot see, which may have some wrong version dependency declaration somewhere, or something you are hitting using an upstream Karaf distribution -which one, the integration/distribution or the netvirt/vpnservice/distribution/karaf, or another one?

Robert, Faseela pointed out to me that this ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.server.nio.SelectChannelConnector cannot be found by org.ops4j.pax.web.pax-web-jetty_4.3.0 shown below is exactly the same as what you discussed with Lori back in February on https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/release/2017-February/009302.html ...

Faseela also says there we still appear to have two different Jetty versions available / loaded (Faseela, could you reply to this with those additional details from IRC?). Is that intentional? IMHO something like that could be cause this kind of version mess confusion in OSGi, and lead to this kind of ClassNotFoundException...

hoping Robert and/or Stephen know more about our Jetty version story which may help clarify what could be going on here.

Tx,
M.

Subject: RE: [Odlparent-dev] Error while installing odl-restconf on master

Hi Michael,
    We are not doing any new features downstream. We just have synced the master code, and built a distribution.
    The only feature we are trying to install is odl-restconf-all. This works in some of the setups, but not always.

     When it works, I do see that HttpService is being pulled in by :

      opendaylight-user at root>bundle:services | grep -B 9 HttpService
OPS4J Pax Web - Jetty (392) provides:

[org.ops4j.pax.web.service.spi.ServerControllerFactory]

OPS4J Pax Web - Runtime (394) provides:

[org.ops4j.pax.web.service.spi.ServletListener]
[org.osgi.service.cm.ManagedService]
[org.osgi.service.http.HttpService, org.ops4j.pax.web.service.WebContainer]


SelectChannelConnector class is seen only in 8.1 version of jetty, I am not sure whether there is any ordering problem in this case.
I do see two jetty-server related jars even in working as well as non-working setups.

org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all-server/8.1.14.v20131031/

We see this error only after karaf4 migration. And it works on some of the setups, but fails in some.
Since the log says ClassNotFoundException, is this some dependency ordering problem?

Faseela, where do you see this, migrating what to Karaf 4? Is this a problem seen only in a downstream distribution we cannot see, which may have some wrong version dependency declaration somewhere, or something you are hitting using an upstream Karaf distribution -which one, the integration/distribution or the netvirt/vpnservice/distribution/karaf, or another one?

Robert, Faseela pointed out to me that this ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.server.nio.SelectChannelConnector cannot be found by org.ops4j.pax.web.pax-web-jetty_4.3.0 shown below is exactly the same as what you discussed with Lori back in February on https://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/release/2017-February/009302.html ...

Faseela also says there we still appear to have two different Jetty versions available / loaded (Faseela, could you reply to this with those additional details from IRC?). Is that intentional? IMHO something like that could be cause this kind of version mess confusion in OSGi, and lead to this kind of ClassNotFoundException...

hoping Robert and/or Stephen know more about our Jetty version story which may help clarify what could be going on here.

Hello aaa-dev,
    I am trying to install a feature defined in netvirt, which has a dependency on odl-restconf.
    My bundle dependencies are not getting resolved properly, and hit the below issue, would like to know whether there was something in recent past which got fixed in this area.

I am trying to get started with aaa source code and in particular its authorization. I got the code from here:
git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/aaa
According to the README.md, AAA is automatically installed upon installation of odl-restconf-noauth and enabled through aaa-shiro-act, but after I built the code and launch karaf, there is no such features in its feature:list. I try to add netconf features repo from ODL Carbon release but odl-restconf-* still cannot be installed (error occurs).


I manually installed odl-aaa-shiro and was able to test the authentication example provided in README.md. However, the authorization example requires restconf as well.


So, where can I get a correct version of restconf to test with aaa? Otherwise, how can I test authorization from a non-RESTCONF context? 


Thanks a lot!

(+Andy, Anil and Thanh)

I think you mean a CSIT job, not the maven verify job right? like this:

https://logs.opendaylight.org/releng/jenkins092/aaa-csit-1node-keystone-all-nitrogen/237/log.html.gz

I'm not sure on this one. /home/jenkins should be there, afaik. I dug back in that
jobs history, and found one where it was like that and working. Actually, I see that
it was fine in job 59 and broken for good in job 60. This was June 26th. I can't find
anything obvious in releng/builder or integration/test that gives a clue.

Andy, Thanh, Anil,

shouldn't this builder (CentOS 7 - docker - 20171016-0023) have /home/jenkins?

Any ideas why /home/jenkins is missing?

Stephen, has this happened with any other testing w/ odlparent 2.0.5?  When
I copy jars locally, I slowly get rid of error messages.  That obviously
isn't desirable.  I also tried to take the default
org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg and starting (in order to download the missing
artifacts from remote repos) but that ran into many issues as well.

Yeah, I did the more rudimentary version of downloading jars manually and
sticking them in system.  I started to unravel that and ran into similar
results.

We identified two issues during yesterday's Kernel Project's call.
1) system/ is not populated properly, which Stephen is working as stated in
the above email. [0]

2) AAA SFT hangs.  [1] addresses the switch off jackson (fails dist-check
due to the fact RESTCONF in NETCONF depended on import of some dependencies
by AAA, so it will likely need a similar transition to GSON too ).  With
[1] layered on the upgrade patch [2] I am still running into a terrible
bundle refresh during SFT... surefire log snippet here:

I do not believe AAA even brings in servicemix bundles, since ""servicemix""
doesn't appear in the dependency tree.

dev at dev:/code/ar2/autorelease/aaa$ mvn dependency:tree | grep -i servicemix
dev at dev:/code/ar2/autorelease/aaa$

Any thoughts on why this may be happening/possible steps forward?  Anything
is appreciated as I am frankly stumped.

Did you happen to get a chance to look at this bundle refresh?  I am asking
since it seems to be referring to a *jasypt* refresh, which AAA doesn't
install AFAICT.  Admittedly, it is strange if SFT works with controller and
not AAA due to this issue, especially since AAA involves security (jasypt
is security related).  I found the jasypt-encryption [0] feature in
upstream karaf, but it is not installed as a part of ""standard"".  Do you
have any knowledge as to why this bundle is even installed in our
distribution?  From my understanding, we are using bouncycastle, not
jasypt, for JCE Provider.  No worries if you don't have any idea, I will
keep digging.

Thanks,

Ryan Goulding

I have no idea unfortunately, I?m as stymied as you by jasypt. I?m
still trying to figure out why we lose
org.apache.karaf.webconsole.http... (I?m also running into refresh
issues with jline, which has the nice side-effect of killing the
console and stopping Karaf. Ho hum.)

One interesting tid-bit is that the empty directories appear in system
when Karaf tries to resolve a bundle at runtime, not at build time, so
it?s worth looking for empty directories just after a build and again
after running.

So if the intention was to maintain the downgrade of javax.mail in our

Could be totally unrelated but I saw that javax.mail was in the refresh
wiring, so figured I'd point it out.

various upstreams [2], so I am going to start on those first.

I've never seen this issue; I think you should open a JIRA about this, to
track it.

If I had to guess, I would think what is happening here must be related to
some refresh issue.. probably AAA get restarted when you do the 2nd feature
installed, you could double check with feature:install -v.

But it look like it's not restartable, it's not happy - and that ""Caused
by: net.sf.ehcache.ObjectExistsException: Cache tokens already exist"" error
line is the interesting one; probably something is already in the cache
from the previous start, and did not get removed on bundle stop, and so
code is not expecting it to already be there - kind of thing? (This is pure
guess work; I'm not familiar with AAA.)

The first question to decide here is: Do we want it to not restart, or do
we want to make it cleanly restartable? I think the solution is the former
(it should not restart; that's a mess).

You may (likely) be able to work around the problem using --no-auto-refresh in
feature install.

https://jira.opendaylight.org/browse/CONTROLLER-1764 has problem which may
be related. Stephen recently something related to that, but that's not in
master yet. Perhaps that will fix this problem as well, when it's available.

M.

I ?Reset? my local build reactor and still ran into the same issues in the previous mail... but admittedly didn?t deeply explore these failures due to competing time slots today with ONAP DDF.

Also a bit confused as to why in the current instructions we don?t have to version bump all projects? odlparent dependencies to 3.0.2-SNAPSHOT. I may be missing something but AAA (and restconf) literally won?t work without these changes applied in step 1 of the instructions in [0] of the previous email... and the current patches listed assume 3.0.1. which was why we initially had issues with AAA. Please keep me honest if I am missing something completely here... or if I misunderstood the build instructions.

Very on board for getting us up and working on the new changes in odlparent and yangtools as soon as possible. Let?s keep this release on track! I?ll help whatever way possible, and will be on all next week to help us get there.

  Raja was hitting the issue for odl-netvirt-openstack + odl-mdsal-apidocs as well.
  That is when he raised the concern.
  However we do not see the problem when we install both the features in one shot.
  Is this already release noted? Or should we raise a separate JIRA?

http://192.168.56.1:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html  is opening properly.


But SSL RESTCONF connection is not opening

I'm trying to integrate Carbon SR2 with my existing Keystone server 
following this guide: 
http://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-carbon/user-guide/authentication-and-authorization-services.html#keystoneauthrealm

However, if I understood correctly, this realm does not provide an 
authorization mechanism. In other words, all users authenticated against 
Keystone will be treated equally.

Do you know if it is possible to set up roles for these Keystone users?

Thank you very much for your help,


Cheers,

Ignacio.

I'm testing AAA project for Carbon SR2 (opendaylight-6.2.0-1.el7 
<http://cbs.centos.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=20319>.rpm). I was working 
on the Certificate Management System in order to enable TLS/SSL for both 
RESTconf and OVS/OF communications, however, I spotted some strange 
behavior in this system.

After a fresh new installation of ODL, the ""/odl-aaa-cert/"" module 
should come installed by default according to this guide 
/http://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-carbon/user-guide/authentication-and-authorization-services.html#id4/. 
Indeed, such module is already installed but it seems the RPC mechanism 
is not available. When I try to retrieve ODL's certificate through 
//restconf/operations/aaa-cert-rpc:getODLCertificate /I'm getting a 503 
Service Unavailable response.

I also found that /ctl.jks/ and /truststore.jks/ files are not created 
under /configuration/ssl// folder after installing ODL. Is this behavior 
expected?

Thanks a lot for your help,


Best regards,

Ignacio.

Yes, I changed it and now the first lines look as follows:

    /? .../

I have seen that after changing the <use-config> option to true, and

remains. Still getting 503 Unavailable.

The suggested command returns the ODL certificate. Something strange is 
going on since I can perform the available operations in the RPC such as 
getODLCertificate or setNodeCertificate through the aaa CLI but not

Subject: [SSL-RESTCONF] Query about etc/custom.properties

Hi Ryan / Evan / Ignacio,

I am able to make SSL-RESTCONF connection by modifying C:\master\distribution\karaf\target\assembly\etc\org.ops4j.pax.web as below:

org.osgi.service.http.secure.enabled=true
org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=8443
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore=configuration/ssl/ctl.jks
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.truststore=configuration/ssl/truststore.jks
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password=opendaylight
org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=opendaylight

I am just wondering if there is any way to make the same work with C:\master\distribution\karaf\target\assembly\etc\custom.properties without modifying org.ops4j.pax.web

Can you please help me out with this ?

Thanks,
Vamsi

I have faced this same error a long time ago (not in Nitrogen though), 
but at the time I wasn't able to figure out the root cause. Which ODL 
version are you using? Nitrogen SR1?

Have you tried cleaning OpenDaylight and restarting the service? I 
usually follow this procedure (in CentOS):

/rm -rf <odl_folder>/data/ <odl_folder>/journal/ <odl_folder>/instances//

and then:

/systemctl restart opendaylight.service/

Afterwards, please check karaf.log and wait until ODL has finished booting.

If this does not solve the problem, I don't know what else you could do. 
Maybe this thread should be moved to a more related mailing list.

Does anyone know what could be the reason of ODL stuck with ""Deploying""?

Best regards,
Ignacio.

Unfortunately, there is chatter of oltu [0] joining Apache Attic [1] in
recent discussions [2] on the oltu dev list.  My messages to
dev at oltu.apache.org have not made it through the strict spam filter, asking
about when we might expect a release containing OLTU-209 [3], a migration
from org.json/json which we also embarking in as a part of ODLPARENT-36
[4].  [2] implies there might be one more release containing this bug fix,
but also states that this project may likely enter the attic.  Since we
depend on oltu [5] since LONG before I joined this project, we need to
assess a way forward.  This could involve replacement of oltu as our OAuth2
implementation.  We could also fork it (it is allowed by the license) or
step up and maintain it properly.  I am posting to see if others have
opinions.  I am in favor of using a more frequently maintained upstream
dependency.

We past our RC0 deadline and we still do not have a working build.

In TSC meeting earlier today (meeting minutes in [1]),  to mitigate risk
TSC decided to drop these 5 projects from the Oxygen Simultaneous Release:

   - eman
   - faas
   - nic
   - unimgr
   - vtn

In addition, TSC decided that the pending patch [2] in bier needs to be
postponed to Fluorine.

At this point, besides working towards a green build, we still need M3
status from these 2 projects:

   - mdsal
   - snmp

We also need M4 status from these 6 projects:

   - aaa
   - mdsal
   - netconf
   - openflowplugin
   - snmp
   - yangtools

Please complete the M3 and M4 status as soon as possible.  The latest
Oxygen release status is frequently being updated here [3].  Thank you!

Best Regards,
Kit Lou

During the DDF we had a kernel projects planning session. Here are my
notes:

	      Fluorine kernel projects planning session


Clustering
==========

Improve clustering: look at the three-node CSIT and fix the
issues. Make it run reliably so it can be used as a stable base.
Distinguish between failures related to the clustering layer itself,
and failures caused by poor clustering support in individual modules.
We know of one Akka issue we're currently tracking but it's hard to
reproduce and difficult to get Akka upstream involved. Start by
getting Vratko's clustering test-suite stable (it doesn't use any
plug-ins), then work on fixing plug-in issues revealed by the full
CSIT suite.

Ask TAC about buying some upstream support from Akka-supporting
companies? (Need to talk to the governing board, add this to the goals
document. Action => Daniel Farrell.)

Use the lab-as-a-service offering from OPNFV, to see whether the
improved reproducibility promised there helps with the issues we're
seeing. However since the issues we're seeing are now back to the same
on Vexxhost as we had with Rackspace, there's a strong possibility
that the issues are inherent to ODL/Akka and not related to the
hosting environment.

Need to reduce the complexity involved in developing plugins which
behave correctly in a clustered environment (recover from failed
connections etc.). Cluster singleton is documented but users need to
satisfy every single API requirement to the letter. We also have
conflicting requirements, and recovery has different meanings for
different services (e.g. deleting state from external hardware when a
cluster node is no longer its owner) ? big mismatch between cluster
singleton requirements and southbound plug-in requirements when the
plug-ins need to synchronise their state across the cluster and with
devices. So at the kernel level we need detailed requirements
describing what other projects want to do; then we could expose new
features if necessary (including Akka features which aren't exposed
currently). Entity ownership service helps a lot.

We will follow up on these points in the kernel call. Action => Anil
Vishnoi to document requirements.

Tell-based: weird behaviour seen in CSIT, need to investigate that
before re-enabling.


Network use
===========

Some plug-ins use the data store for high volume storage, which
results in heavy network use. The data store isn't designed for this
use case, and perhaps we should define limits beyond which other tools
should be used (Cassandra etc.)

We need performance testing, and work on updating our published
performance numbers. We need to instrument performance testing so we
can spot regressions and measure improvements (see Bitergia).


Data store debugging
====================

What is the recommended way to retrieve the data store contents from a
non-shard-leader node? Ask-based Akka limits the amount of data we can
transfer; with tell-based we'll be able to do better. Whether this
makes it in Fluorine is still uncertain.


AAA
===

Removal of web.xml in favour of the code-based configuration
framework.

Jackson migration, done today.

Replace the OLTU-based token server.

More protection, better encryption.


Controller
==========

Fluorine: a lot of clean-up:
* DataChangeListener is up for removal; it was deprecated in Carbon
  and scheduled for removal in Fluorine. All the ODL projects have
  been converted away from DCL; downstream projects *will* need to
  perform the same migration after Fluorine is
  released. DataTreeChangeListener provides a better interface with
  better performance.
* The controller implementations of the MD-SAL APIs should be dropped
  in favour of the MD-SAL versions. This will take many releases but
  we will start deprecating them in Fluorine.
* The Config Sub-System is up for removal. The people who wrote it no
  longer maintain it, and all of ODL has already switched to
  BluePrint.
* The in-memory datastore will be removed (it's also available in
  MD-SAL).


MD-SAL
======

Binding v2 won't be ready in Fluorine.

Binding v1 is being retro-fitted to fix the more grievous issues (see
the mailing list). This will allow v1 to keep us ticking over until v2
is ready.

Clean up the DOM-level APIs to better support new use cases.

Support for actions and nested notifications in Fluorine and possible
Oxygen SR2.

MD-SAL will probably become release-based at the end of Fluorine.


Infrautils
==========

See the dedicated Infrautils session.


NETCONF
=======

Same trajectory, nothing major (maintenance mode).

We need to start testing the RFC 8040-based version of NETCONF
(instead of bierman).


Federation
==========

The project is dead; if anyone wants to revive it, see Robert Varga.

Subject: Announcing that Apache Oltu has been moved to the Attic


Announcing that the Apache Oltu committers have voted to retire the
project due to inactivity. Oltu was an OAuth protocol implementation in
Java. It also covers others ""OAuth family"" related implementations such
as JWT, JWS and OpenID Connect.

Retiring a project is not as simple as turning everything off, as
existing users need to both know that the project is retiring and
retain access to the necessary information for their own development
efforts. You can read more about Oltu's retirement at:
http://attic.apache.org/projects/Oltu.html The user mailing list
remains open, while the rest of the project's resources will continue
to be available in a read-only state - website, wikis, svn, downloads
and bug tracker with no change in url. Providing process and solutions
to make it clear when an Apache project has reached its end of life is
the role of the Apache Attic, and you can read more about that at:
http://attic.apache.org/ 

Thanks, Jan Iversen on behalf of the Apache Attic and the now retired
Apache Oltu project

During the Kernel call this past Tuesday, we talked about attempting an
isolated transition of AAA restful web services from Jersey 1 to Jersey 2.
I attempted this change yesterday, and was able to partially convert (I
just temporarily removed non-essential code that would've required
overhaul).  However, when I compiled NETCONF next to test RESTCONF, I
quickly realized that:

1) jersey-2.26 won't behave well, since it relies on javax.ws.rs-api 2.1
and jersey 1.17 relies on javax.ws.rs-api 2.0.1.  This leads to a Uses
constraint violation since the dependency is provided via two chains (and
two different versions too!).

2) jersey-2.25 won't work for a similar reason.  Even though it relies on
the older javax.ws.rs-api 2.0.1 which is currently in place, jersey 1.17
repackages javax.ws.rs-api.  This means that utilizing the off the shelf
javax.ws.rs-api 2.0.1 causes another Uses constraint violation, since the
dependency is provided via upstream properly and jersey 1.17 in a
repackaged form.

I am starting to really agree with the sentiment that we should just stick
to only one implementation across the board.  Additionally, I believe that
isolating this in an API (utility or not) will help the transition since
there will be a single point to toggle the implementations.  We may want to
also discuss the drawbacks of jersey 2.  Namely, it appears to require a
ton of overhead dependencies and starts a bit slower in newer versions.
Maybe that is fine, but we should fully understand the tradeoffs before
investing more time.  We should also settle on what the intended version
should be for jersey 2 if we go that route, since jersey-2.26 is a lot
different than even jersey-2.25.

Thoughts?

Ryan

Subject: Re: Configuring OpenLdap with ODL

Hi Harshit,

Did you replace the values in shiro.ini between square brackets <> with the appropriate values for your LDAP server?  By the way, ODL Beryllium is very old and has not been supported for quite some time.

Ryan Goulding

One issue is that you are using ODLJndiLdapRealm without the
""ldapRealm.attributeForComparison"" set.  I would start off with using the
variant ODLJndiLdapRealmAuthNOnly to start, then as you figure out AuthN
add in AuthZ later.  If you don't define the attributeForComparison, things
won't work.

Thanks for the help. I have successfully integrated openldap with odl.

I have one concern, is it necessary to restart karaf after updating shiro.ini file. Because in my case odl is not allowing me to login through openldap after updating shiro.ini until and unless we restart karaf.
Is there any procedure or way through which can skip the restarting of karaf.

code into the AAA repository since we use very little anyway [0].  I do
believe we will want to eventually get rid of the AAA OAuth2 Provider
anyway in favor of federation with existing OAuth2 system(s), since AAA
team has attempted to avoid becoming an IdP.  If we combined [0] with
deprecating the HTTP API(s) in Fluorine, followed by an investigation of
OAuth2 Provider federation, I think we will be in much better shape.
Thoughts?  [0] will get us away from org.json as well, since the upstream
migration was never released but is in the code!

Owning an OAuth2 Provider is costly, and I believe many solutions suggest
using OpenID instead.  The fact is, ODL is a Network Controller, not a
tokening system.  Right now, our OAuth2 system does not really reflect an
accurate OAuth2 deployment model, and is really closer to an OAuth1
authentication tokening system anyway. Open to entertain conversation on
this.
